My Laptop is a year and a month old now.My laptops hinges are broken. I can hear the cracking sounds of plastic inside body and the P0 phillips broad head screws have started to fall apart. I am afraid closing the laptop lid is going to harm even more. The laptop has never had any kind of physical incidents so it safe to keep it out of the equation.I see this is a common problem for this model occurring anytime after 10 months of it usage.   What is the suggested response to this ? Since this is clearly NOT because of my mis-handling of the laptop. My case is very similar to this post : https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...

My laptop top lid cannot be closed. Whenever I am trying to close it the hinge is bulging out, forcing the screen bizel to come out. My laptop model is HP PAVILION AU006TX.  I can understand that the hinge has broken. Can someone tell me the price to change the hinge(original HP part). Also, the HP repair service centre near me is not picking up the phone. I am trying for the last 7 days. Here is his details.

The hinge on my laptop is broken and the screen is nearly falling out every time I open it. Just contacted HP support and they said it would cost about £230  (about 40% of what i paid for the laptop) which is ridiculous is, or I can have a 7% discount on a new laptop. Why would I want a new HP laptop if the design and customer service is this bad??? There's obviously a design error on this as lots of posts saying the same thing. Did anyone ever get a satisfactory result from HP or are we all just left in limbo?

Hi, It is unbelievable to find hundred of users having exactly the same problem. I recently have left hinge broken on Spectre XT. Please advise if this issue is well known and supported by your customer support in Thailand. I am going to call them on Monday. My Spectre is out of warranty and I am curious to know how would HP react to such flawed design. Well, I was thinking to buy new Spectre as I thought it was only mine broken. I am scared now as this could happen to the new one too although it seems the new ones have different hinge design. Thanks,Pairoj

Hi support,My screen is shot due to the poor hinges on the screen. The bezel has now popped off in the bottom right corner where the screws that hold the screen to the hinge just came off, there were bits of plastic falling out of there too. can you help? I cant believe I paid so much for a laptop that is literally falling apart. I am out of warranty,  but hoping theres something you can do about it.

Hi, I bought hp envy x360 13 in Jan 2021, I always use it on my desk, never even brought it to anywhere... one day I was opening the laptop, and I heard crackling sound, and it was the hinge... the screen is completely fine, not damaged at all, but the problem is in the hinge only... I went to HP verified service center in my country (Jordan), and they told me that it would cost me (320JOD) which is equal to 450USD!! This is really disappointing, as I used it very gently for a year or so, and never moved it from my desk...Is there is any solution?Here is a photo for my laptop:

Below is a question I posted 1-21-2021 I have not heard from a support agent ""helped"" me and I accepted the solution. However my problem is not solved. It seems like other notebook owners are having a similar problem. I have not dropped my notebook but the left hinge has broken.  It seems like a product defect that should have been recalled! Hello everyone, I have an HP laptop that has cracked on the upper left corner. The hinge has also broken and I have to leave the lid open. I have not dropped the laptop and it seems that other people have posted this same issue. What can be done if it is not under warranty. This really sounds like a product defect.

Hi, I have (amongst others) an HP Office jet 6210 printer given to me 12 years ago by my daughters. It has performed magnificent service over the past 12 years, but alas, as seems to be the case with many other owners, both ADF hinges have broken (the hinges supporting the main body you lift when replacing cartridges). I have purchased replacement hinges as I am loathe to throw away a present from my daughters but the left hinge sits lower than the right when screwed in with the Hex 12 screws. This means the left side of the lid now ""sits"" on the printer body (it was always lower than the right side (and most people in the community appear to comment that the left hinge breaks first). I have checked the broken old hinges with the new ones and they are identical. So, can anyone please help me to keep this prized and trusted jewel working?Thank you in anticipation.

In the beginning of October 2020 I contacted HP via Whatsapp because the screen cover on the bottom left of the screen came off. Now, several months later, it is worse and yesterday evening the hinge broke when I closed my laptop!! I want to get this fixed, because I read that many others have this problem too and it's ridicuous to think that a €1000,- gaming laptop breaks that fast!!! See pictures below to see how badly it's broken.oktober 2020june 2021

The bottom right corner of my computer screen popped open the other day.  Today I tried to open it and the (now apparently broken) hinge crushed through the front glass. Two small screws or rivets fell out and it cannot be open or shut without doing further damage.  Other than that it works great.  Given that I bought it in late 2017, it is out of warranty, but I wanted to post here to see if the admin or community had any advice or suggestions.  It's a great laptop.  I'm really bummed it's broken like this.  I would love to get it fixed with minimal cost. Is this some kind of recall maybe?  ThanksBen

About a a few months or so ago, my hinge started opening a bit stiffer than usual. I took extra care opening my laptop after that but just now a screw finally popped out from who knows where. Part of the right side of the display and the hinge is now open. And I cannot fully open or close this laptop. It still powers on (thank god). Please let me know on what steps I could do to fix this with the quarantine in place, I am a student and this is my only means of getting my work done. Thank you.

I have had a HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx for roughly 2 years now. I have never had a problem with any other brands of laptop and damage not caused by myself. My laptops normally last 4-5 years, so after only 2 years the hinge breaking on this laptop is not acceptable.  I have seen many complaints about hp laptops and hinges breaking, and also complaints by customers stating hp knows about these faults and does nothing to stop them from happening. I rely on my laptop for every day work.  I cannot send it away to get repaired. Nor should I have to pay for damage which is clearly a design fault. If I do not get a reply on this platform from hp I will be contacting customer services and asking to speak to a supervisor to get this dealt with quickly. Thank you

The glass screen cracked and the hinge that attaches to the stand snapped. I would love to be able to replace these but I can't find the parts or they aren't available. What can I do? Product number: 2NL12AA#ABG. Thanks!

When I closed my laptop earlier, the right hinge broke to where I cannot open it again or fully close it the remaining couple of inches. A couple shards of plastic broke off, too. There is now a gap between the inner and outer casing around my screen where it connects to the hinge. How do I go about fixing this?

I am trying to find out if there is a printer repair center near Houston that works on HP inkjet printers? I have a HP Envy 7640 and a small little hinge ( not sure what else to call it), that helps feed the paper through the machine has broken. I've tried Best Buy/Geek Squad and they said they do not. Any help, would be appreciated. Looking for someone that can order that part and ""install"" it.

I have a broken hinge on the right side of the scanner cover of an HP Officejet Pro 8610 printer.  A company called Mara Import Services says they can fix it for $170.  I paid $100 (on sale) for the printer about 6 years ago.  The printer still works but awkward to lift scanner cover with the broken hinge.  I still have quite a few extra 950 (black) and 951 (colored) cartridges for the printer.  Best Buy and Office Max can't fix it nor do they know of any other printers that use those cartridges.  Does anyone know if that model is still available somewhere or another model that would use those cartridges?  Otherwise, my options as I see it are:  pay the fee to repair the printer and keep it;  live with it the way it is now until I use up my cartridges and buy a new printer with different cartridges; or bite the bullet now and get a new printer/cartridges.

Sadly, I join a group of many other HP Omen purchaser who have hinge problems that have scared, broken, and altered their laptops. My Omen 17-w gaming laptop did just the same. I bought a special back pack for my expensive purchase to keep it safe. But to no avail, not only did my laptop hinges break on both sides of my screen but my warranty ended before I could use it as well. Then the cherry on top is how many people have shared the same complaint online as far back as 2017 to my knowledge because there are bound to be more. My head hurts with the fact that HP knew and did not correct this issue in the appropriate time frame. The lack of support online for this issue is crazy with so many people having it. I would of thought that at least a repair video would of been made. If there is one then I have not found it and I have been on the search for two days looking for an HP OMEN 17-w hinge repair video and have not found one. How can I have my laptop hinges loosened so that I can use it? Also my wifi connector cords are cut when the screen on the right side disconnected so what is the correct term for those items? I'm tired of looking around online to find no support or information to solve my problems that HP has known about for three years.

Hi,I have bought a laptop from Currys pc world (UK) which now has a broken hinge and the bezel is coming unglued from the screen (with light use, poor design).I have 5 months left of extended warranty HP care pack. When trying to contact HP via the app on laptop and I enter UK as purchase location I am directed to Currys pc world support. However, they are saying I have no warranty with them so they will not repair or replace.Did I waste my money on the HP extended warranty ?Can I get it repaired through warranty?If not will HP refund the money I spent on the warranty?Thx for any advise how to resolve this situation.

Similiar to other posters, the screen and hinge on the right side of the HP ENVY x360 is separated form the Body of the pc.  It is only 17 months old, and has not been operated in a Note pad mode ever !!.  I used it solely as a desktop PC .  This is a terrible example of the JUNK quality of HP products ..  I have owned at least 4 HP Laptops (this being 1 of the 4), none of the other 3 were ever this bad.  WHAT IS HP GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS ?????  I had to scotch tape the screen corner so it doesn't completely separate from the body at the notorious right Corner , which is exactly what others have posted - the right corner.  I will be looking elsewhere for PCs in the future ..........

Long story short, my wife's laptop fell and cracked it's casing/shell near the screen hinge as pictured below. Luckily the laptop appears to be functioning normally, but we'd still like to repair/replace the broken piece. What options do we even have, (either having it sent in, buying a replacement piece ourselves, etc...) and how much would it likely cost?

Since 2005 I've always depended on an Hp Laptop. Some came with remotes and this last one was such a beauty to look at. I bought it over knowing it had all the options I needed it to complete  daily activities and run a small business. The computer  quickly began  having an issue with the hinge. The u unusual stiffness and other mechanisms I cant explain lead to a crack in frame and somehow is effecting the screen to have faded or blank areas.  This Laptop only had 25%of my usual workload with other HP LAPTOPS.  Every time I used the laptop now, it is drastically  loosing it's  ability to handle any workload. I put it down for some time now and barely open it. My productivity is at an all time low. I was looking to buy another laptop and was torn between repairing this laptop. I see the new series Omen has a single hinged design. Upon more research, I see that my laptop design is definitely  Defective!What are my Options? I know I'm way past warranty but no one could tell me ahead of time that a gaming Hp laptop could not last 2years  living a decent life. 1. I would like to send it back and get an upgraded version.2. Please somebody reach out because I need a laptop yesterday and cant afford the next choice not to live up to the quality  I was used  to.

Hello,The left hinge came off the back cover. I sent the laptop to the authorized service but they said that this defect is not part of the warranty. The warranty is extended so the laptop is still under warranty. I would like to know if this type of defect is part of the warranty.

						I have a spectre X-360 convertible I opened it up and watch the spring or something behind the hinge break the screen and Crack across from the bottom right-hand corner. It just sits on my desk no falls or abuse. Just opened it. I am 100 days past the warranty. Obviously this is not anecessary unusual issue. I have found that with my first search inquiry about it. I turned off the touch screen so I could continue using it. I used the computer to generate a case number and called support. The employee was so extremely rude. Yes my warranty is up. But I may buy another product from HP in the future. Should treat the callers better. Anyways I finally was able to get a couple words in and told him I would try another support option. What options do I have with this common problem. Is it on a recall for CPSC or anything. Any info would help.

HP Pavilion x360 - 14-cd0050tuMy wife uses this laptop daily on a desk and had never used the screen rotation feature until yesterday when she opened the display to tablet mode. When fully opened to tablet mode there was an immediate small cracking noise from the display, just above the right hand facing hinge. When the screen was returned to normal laptop position, the display screen protruded and cracked just above the right hand facing hinge. Two screws and pieces of plastic fell out as well. Looking at the screws it was clear the bushels the screws screw into, had broken the plastic on the display back cover. The screws were still screwed firmly into the bushels but the plastic around the bushels had given way (see photo of the 2 screws). This is a common design fault of not just this model but several HP models in the past. I am a retired HPE and spent several years repairing HP laptops under warranty and HP authorization. This damage has been caused by a component failure and not user induced damage. The laptop is outside the one year standard warranty but considering that such a major component has failed within 2 years of purchase, through no fault of the eu and there are dozens of similar posts on this forum, HP should cover this repair. Examples follow.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/td-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hinge-and-Screen-falling-Apart...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinge-envy-laptop/td-p/...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/ENVY-X360-Screen-cracks-for-no-reason...My wife really loves this laptop and would like it repaired at HP expense please.Considering parts for the display are not available individually and a full display would be required to fix the issue, this should not become an issue for the eu. The full display unit would be highly expensive and is not available from HP Parts store either.

Broken hinge on 7mo. old  X360 14"" 2 in 1 laptop. Spent over an hour on phone with customer no service. Sent pictures of broken hinge which in turn cracked screen.  Was told they evaluated pictures and said was caused by physical damaged. Not covered by workmanship warranty. It was never dropped, hit, bumped abused in any way. After reading several posts. Well over a hundred. I came to the conclusion this is an inherent problem with this model. HP wants $410.66 to fix what is a defect. Unacceptable. Anyone have this problem fixed through warranty?Received a message from HP they would help me out. Needed to send them serial number and case number. 4 weeks ago and since have heard nothing from them? I keep sending them messages but no answers. Any suggestions?

Did HP fix it? I have the same exact problem and have been getting the run around. My laptop is still under warranty but HP won't fix it! They told me they don't cover accidental damage (which this is not - I have never dropped or misused my laptop. It's only 7 months old and has only ever been opened and closed normally. Never dropped or even transported anywhere!!) The hinge broke and cracked the casing simply by me closing the lid. I have had to pay out of pocket to get the repair done and am trying to get HP to reimburse me for this obvious design flaw. Did they fix yours?? If they aren't willing to stand behind their warranty and aren't making this right for people, I am looking to see if there are any others having the same problem to  try to get them to address the issue.

Hello,  Hoping you can help. I was carefully taking apart my HP Pavilion All-in-One PC for cleaning/maintenance and accidentally broke the black plastic piece which secures the display ribbon to the screen. Can anyone tell me what this black plastic piece is called and possibly where I can buy a replacement (in Canada)? Unfortunately, the picture is too large of a file size for me to attach.   Thank you!!

I recently moved house and following the move my trusty HP laser CP3525dn has stopped printing in black.  I dont recall it getting damaged during the move as I carried it myself but... I can print all of the colours except black. I have so far:> Printed test and calibration pages - black does not print all other colours work> Replaced the black toner with a new one (figuing old toner was faulty) - still no black ink output with new black toner> Checked the pressure lever as per (http://www.hp.com/cpso-support-new/pq/CP3525/blackmissingcolor.html)> I have had a good old look inside the printer and the toners slide in and out fine - cant see anything broken? Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

I purchased my laptop 2 years ago and the hinge broke recently although I was taking really good care of the laptop and it was never dropped or hit. As my warranty expired, I thought I would be cheaper to get it fixed by a technician, however, he couldn’t find the part that needs to be replaced anywhere and he told me that the price is approximately 250-360£ for that part to be bought and get installed (if found). As a student I definitely cannot afford it and I am really disappointed as the laptop’s price was 1100£ and it basically only lasted 2 years. I read a LOT of complaints about the same issue online, as well as from my friends who got the same model after my recommendation. I emailed HP 2 times but hasn’t got any response back. Shouldn’t HP take responsibility of that problem as it is acknowledged that it’s clearly a design flaw?

I bought this 28/10/2019 and have used it daily ever since. It has never left the house and I have been careful not to damage it in any way. All of a sudden there was a cracking noise and I am now unable to shut the case without the screen pulling away from the body. Reading this forum it seems to have been a common fault for some time - why have HP not done something about it? Prevously I had been more than happy with the machine. Before this I had a smaller HP model which was fine but because of the small memory only suitable for basic tasks so I upgraded.Supplier is not interested as it is out of warranty, we live in the country, there is no repair shop handy and I can`t do without it for any period of time so is it possible to fix it at home, bearing in mind I am not particularly tech-savvy.As mentioned I was quite happy with HP products but if this can`t be sorted I won`t be sticking with them.

Others have posted here and support has reached to assist.  The issue described below appears to be common. My lightly used laptop (unfortunately a few months out of warranty)  broke unexpectedly today. The left hinge broke through the display bezel instead of opening normally.   From my examination of the damaged hinge it would appear that a fastener was ""missing"" on original assembly. The laptop was given to  me by a non-profit organization for whom I serve as their volunteer web master. I'm quite certain that it's ""not in the budget"" for this PC to be replaced so soon. For now I""m using the laptop with an external monitor. I would appreciate an option for a low cost repair.[personal information removed]

This is not a request for help but rather a message that this was solved.My  printer was printing blank pages and the left top lid cover hinge had broken. I did not realize that this opened the laser shutter until I read about it on here in another topic. So I downloaded the HP4000 service manual - google HP4000 service manual - and dismantled the printer right side and top cover. I removed all the broken pieces and located the shutter which is at the top of the black laser assembly. It is spring loaded. Suggestions I saw were to use a pencil eraser to hold it open. I thought that was a potential problem way to do it as the eraser could come dislodged and  jam somewhere. Instead I used a material called coax seal which is a malleable substance not unlike clay used to seal RF connectors. I pushed the shutter open and applied a liberal amount of the material so it could not close. I did this on both sides to be safe. I suppose the shutter could just be removed but I did not want to take a chance of damaging something doing that. In the end the printer prints fine with a new old stock 27A cartridge.  The printer has printed 36400 pages which I guess is low for its age. It is a home network printer and has worked great for years.

I had the problem that others have, with the annoying sound of the scan bar moving back and forth, not parking when not in use. I tried everything you could imagine! Then I pushed lightly down on the top of the scan bed and found the the lid is not heavy enough! I put some weight on it and the scan bar parked! I hope this helps!     Please fix this issue, HP!                          Thank-You very much!

Hey! I bought the 2021 model of the HP Envy laptop around one year ago when I recently noticed a problem with the left hinge. When opening and closing the laptop, the case pops open a little, and when the laptop is closed the screen portion is slightly misaligned on the left side from the keyboard section. It can be fixed by pushing it into place but when opening adn closing it again the problem reoccurs.  The laptop has no other issues besides this. I've been taking good care of it since I've bought it and I'm very worried the problem will worsen. Is there a quick fix to the problem or do I need to use the warranty? Thanks.

I too have had the left hinge on my HP Envy 17 TS break.  It is now to the point where the hinge is no longer operable.  The case is broken and separated by close to an inch.  It was out of warranty when it started and I could not afford a repair. I purchased the PC in June 2014 and it operates fine.  However, I must now be in the market for a new PC because of the hinge and case.  My question is ""has the hinge issue been resolved or if I get a new 17 TS Envy, is the same problem going to occur"".  I like the 17"" and like the touch screen but if this is a continued design issue, I will need to look at another type of PC. Also, it would be nice to have a discount toward a new PC due to this design flaw.

Recently I noticed a slight issue with hinges on my laptop screen, where it was making a cracking noise whenever i opened or closed it. Recently the frame started peeling off, and i cant close the screen as the back hinge would come off. Is it covered, if not, how much would it cost to fix this issue. Thank you

Hi!I've got an OMEN 15 (15-ek0xxx) three months ago and recently I noticed an issue with the ""R"" key.  The key is faulty, it works inconstantly (it stops working and starts suddenly), for example, while I am writing this text some words that contain ""R"" are typed correctly and sometimes it is not. When I am playing, the key stops for a longer period. I need to push it and keep pressing till it works. I've seen a few posts with the same problem (but different keys and different OMEN model) but none of them with a real solution. It doesn't seem to be a hardware issue, since the key works if I keep it pressed (without tapping many times) and according to the other posts too. What should I do??

Hello, I have common problem with my laptop, my right hinge broken and it caused damage on my upper cover. I'm able to fix it on my own, but I can't find specific upper cover for my laptop. On the Internet i only found pretty much the same, but it's not. Slot for hard drive is in place where my battery should go. Do You guys have any idea where I can get proper parts? My product number is Z3B69EA#AKD.Sorry for my poor English. Have a nice day P.S. I run out of my warranty

My Officepro 8100 is out of warrenty.  I am trying the twitter bit. but I am RARELY on Twitter.. I am on Facebook.. but this really has zero to do with any of that. I want to know if
A: the part (the output tray extension and EndStop)  IS replaceable.
B: How to replace it
C: How much it will cost
 And can I order it. 
 
I don't know why a piece that can break off easily.. is not listed as a part to be available to be replaced.  I'm not buying a whole new printer just for that.
 
Thanks

Hello, I purchased the HP Omen around 2 years ago. The notebook has been fine, up until recently (a few weeks ago.) I noticed that the hinge that connects the screen wobbles, opens when closed by a quarter inch or so, and is extremely unstable. For the price of this notebook, I have no other way to put it; this is horse **bleep**. My warrante has expired (of course) and i'd like to know how to go about fixing this ridiculous issue, that has no reason to exist.

Hi, I'd bought my HP Pavilion 15 gaming laptop around March last year, and am disappointed to report that the hinge has broken despite lack of any manhandling. It seems that many people have this issue, and since I have unfortunately run out of warranty, I can't just send it back.Please advice.

The ""A"" key on my Omen X 17t laptop now no longer provides any input to the computer.  The other keys work fine, so I do not think that this is a software problem.  The key itself does not appear to be stuck; it depresses to the same extent that other keys do, snaps back, and makes the same clicking noise.  However, when pressed the computer does not register that the key has been pressed. It's worth noting that at first the key would work unreliably.  That is, in the hour before this happened it would occasionally not register a key press and then work fine for several presses after that.  Then it stopped working completely. I have tried clearing any debris from around or under the key, and there doesn't seem to be anything major there (though of course there's probably some dust and stray hairs/eyelashes, etc. as you usually get with a keyboard).  I haven't removed the key because I am worried about breaking the key and not being able to put it back on the keyboard (this happened to me with a previous laptop).  Is there anything which could be causing this other than something physically jamming the key?  And if it is something under the key which I need to remove by removing the key, are there are any guides or tips for how I can do that without damaging the keyboard?

I bought a HP Envy 13 (2019) in September of 2019. I have noticed an issue with the hardware in which the chassis of the case appear to open slightly when the screen is opened with a crack sound. I have treated the laptop very well. But now the laptop hinge is completely lose and it got broken. My laptop is still working though. However, the laptop has this issue for couple of months and I tried to fix this issue with hp help service before any serious damage occur. Unfortunately, the damage that I expected occurred and I am scared for any further issues to happen. Back to the help service, they did not help me at all and they literally left my case opened. My device is still under warranty and it will well end soon . I never expected Hp will have this treatment with there customers. My case was opened since 4 months and still no reply. I am so disappointed with this honestly.

Hello everyone! Recently received a quite expensive business laptop and on 3rd day of usage right hinge does not look so good (see attached photos). Technically and aesthetically.Question is: Does HP warranty will cover that case, or should I wait when laptop will be finally broken? (and the go to HP service center). Thanks \

Hi,I purchased my HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx in June 2019. Like many people have experienced in this thread, my laptop hinge has broken on one side and the laptop bezel/frame is popping off and causing issues. There are small parts breaking off the back and the frame has cracked. I have attached photos of this damage, it makes a cracking sound when I move the screen and seems to get worse with movement. This seems to be a common issue. Could I be advised on what to do please?Thanks.

Hi I've got an issue with a HP EliteBook 745 G4. English speaking official support wont help me because I'm in Guatemala and not their area and I can't speak very good spanish. I'm hoping a clever tech-mind not condemned within the illusion of borders can help me here. The laptop was perched on a small box and due to a kitten attack it fell backwards by about 10cm onto a mattress and now the screen image is mangled. It was a very gentle fall, I'm surprised it even affected it. I think the screen bent backwards just that little bit too suddenly. Anyway, the screen isn't cracked externally, there is no noticeable physical damage. Something's cracked inside. The pixels react when I put pressure on the screen moving it back and forth on its hinge. It seems to be booting up fine. No beeps or lights. I can sometimes see the startup screen if I bend the screen but its only the top corner and I can't see enough to make any modifications easily. It's a great little computer with a lot of work on it, I'd really like to fix it. I bought it second hand in Mexico last year but it's still under warranty. Do you think it's a simple screen replacement? Or could it be another software/hardware issue? I have bought a cheaper replacement for now but I can't really work on it with its crappy specs. I'm hoping to use the screen however as a monitor for the broken one so I can test if its actually the screen that needs replacing. Does anyone have any experience with hooking up a second laptop screen to a broken one?  Keyboard commands etc.  I have a HDMI cable and I'm running Windows 10 on both.  So far my efforts have fallen flat. Any advice would be great, feeling a bit stuck at the mo. Thanks I-need-my-fix

I bought new HP ENVY X360 3 months ago in 29.08.21. Yesterday when I closed the screen I heard a cracking noise. I opened the laptop and found out that the right hinge was broken and out and there was a crack in the screen from the hinge attachment area. I contacted support today (11/15/2021), they checked laptop cracked screen and they told me that i couldn't prove that it wasn't my fault and they were unable to help, because it was not under warranty. it is clear breaking of screen was caused by broken hinge. The only way to prevent this issue would have been if I had known the hinge was faulty and never have opened or closed my laptop. Can anybody foresee that just closing the laptop simply would break hinge which at the same time would also crack the screen?! This is ridiculous.

I purchased a HP laptop for the first time so I went on a laptop available for the lowest price because I don't know how much a laptop last. I purchased G6 250 because the HP recommended me that business laptop are much more durable. I use my laptop on a table just like a desktop I never took my laptop while travelling but in a timespan about 2 years my laptop noted issues with motherboard(3 times), hard-disk(1 time)(Yeah, I was also confused), network card(1 time), suddenly hinge too. I first call up the onsite and they told me that the hinge was broken from inside (without even opening the laptop) then I took it to a service centre they also told me that it can only be done in a chargeable basis. The twist: The onsite service customer care was also done without opening of the laptop and they sent the parts. The service centre (Sysnet Global at Bowbazar) sent me a quotation of about 5k in onsite and 16k at offsite for the same issue. Now I was actually confused whether was there any problem or not so I took it to a actually professional the professional just loosen the hinge and a tighten a screw which came out and the laptop was fixed in just 30 mins and the onsite and offsite took 16 days for the same issue I just want to know why there are so huge difference between the service centre and the onsite serive and my laptop didn't needed any parts to be replaced. From the above attached picture it can easily be noted that there was no physical damage. Even when I took my laptop to that professional I visited a rog centre for my next laptop and I was not alone 2 people with the same event visited that rog store the shop staff told me I would like that HP takes a hard decision on the sevice centre because if that service centre is doing it to almost every one if this doesn't stop HP is going to make a huge loss in Kolkata. This monopoly started when Sysnet Global was the only service centre at the heart of the city and they don't have a good reputation you can even go to the actual ground situation.

 I purchased a HP envy touch smart i7 laptop in 2014 from Bangladesh. But after using it for 3 months the hinge broke off and one side cover is gap open where hinges broke. I was wondering how could it happen? As I didn't do any forcing on this.So I took it to the computer source the distributor from whom I purchased it. They told me it is not under warranty cover as the parts is broken. So I am using it like that for 2 years as PC. So I don't have to close the lid. But Now I know there is a lot of people facing the same problem. Hinges broken problem.  So I would like to ask If this is a manufacturer defect? and What is the solution for broken hinges?

Hello,The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner and two screws fell out together with some small, plastic pieces.My warranty ran out last June (2019). I literally moved the laptop an inch to the right and the hinge broke. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way, rather taking really good care of it, considering I had to pay close to $1,000 for it. Based on the tons of complaints around this same problem on this forum (and elsewhere) it is obvious that the hinge design is really poor.I am obviously very unhappy with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem.A computer in this price range should not break after just more than one year of normal usage!

Hello,My HP Envy 15t laptop left hinge broke and the left corner is cracked and bulging. The laptop was not dropped or fell. When I open and close the laptop the hinge is shifting and then seperating lower case from the upper case. The screw from the lower case are falling off and I am not able to close and open the laptop properly. The warranty is expired on this laptop. Please help.

 Anyone else have a problem with the display hinges on the HP Pavilion x360 coming apart ? With my laptop, the lcd screen detached from the back lid without getting dropped or mishandled in anyway . Laptop stays put in one place actually. Simply used it one day and the next day when I opened it, it let out a horrible creaking sound. The display had come apart and was ‘drooping’ on one side. For reference  I bought slightly over a year ago ( so I’m out of warranty).  Laptop has had issues from the go. HP support wanted me to part with cash to get it fixed. Hope hp gets my problem and solve it for me

I’ve had my Envy for 4 years.  I’m not rough with it, it generally sits on a desk and doesn’t move. I was just on an 8 day trip (laptop was not with me).   No one was in my house while I was gone however when I got home and went to open it to do some work, the casing completely separated from the screen and one of the hinges seems to have broken.   Pieces have literally fallen out of the gap that now exists.  I’ve taken pics but it seems impossible to find a good email for customer service.    Apparently my warranty expired in 2019.  Is there nothing that HP will do?   This was not a cheap laptop and should have lasted longer than 4 years, especially when it doesn’t get moved around much at all.  I’ve been loyaL to this brand for a long time, so I’m incredibly disappointed in this.  Thanks!

Hello! I manage several hundred chromebooks and repair them as needed, and I've got one that I've seen twice now and not found a good solution for.  My issue is that we have a Chromebook 11 G3 that has a dark screen, very faintly you can see what should be displayed. Not a case of the brightness being turned down, but rather the LED backlighting on the screen appears not to be working. I've now tried replacing, screen, motherboard and display cable in an attempt to fix this issue. The screens were brand new, as were the replacement screen cables, though the mother boards were second hand. HDMI is still functional in all cases.  I have called HP support and not gotten any information other than ""replace the motherboard"".  As I have now seen this twice in the past month and all of those devices were purchased at the same time I have concerns that this may be more frequent.  I guess my question would be if there is a schematic for testing the boards or information on fuses that might have blown and could be jumpered or replaced. I would also love to know if anyone else is running into this issue. I would also be thankful for any resources on testing procedures for components like the screen and output on the eDP connector. I have a little background in electronics and don't mind testing and/or soldering. Also, I have already tried powerwashing/resetting the device to no avail, stating that as I know almost all of the support responses get that procedure pasted in as a fix. It is not for this issue.

Printer has started to make harsh noise as if sprokets were broken or misaligned.  Can't see any problems with internals, but have not taken printer apart.  It only makes this noise sometimes, but did this morning - quite alarming.  After thorough visible inspection, rotating cogs inside, checking no paper jam, it behaved perfectly, both photocopy and print from computer.  However, I suspect the problem will recur.  Anyone experienced this problem, or had it diagnosed?   Thanks.

My laptop is less than 9 months old.The hinges have become disconnected from the screen. It appears that the screws no longer stay in their little holes in the plastic and they've all fallen out completely. As a result the screen is no longer able to stay up under it's own weight and I am very concerned that this will lead to further damage to the machine.  The laptop is only 9 months old and has never had any sort of incident. I can now see that this is a common issue with these machines as any cursory internet search will attest.  What is the suggested response to this ? Since this is clearly NOT because of my mis-handling of the laptop. As I've had this for less than a year I assume that I'm still covered by the warranty.

Same problem with Pavillion x360.   Purchased March 2020.  Left hinge broke end of August pulling screen away from back cover.   Still under warranty.  Returned for warranty repair and unit was received at HP Service Center 9/2.  Paid the extra $15 for expedited 3-5 day turnaround time.  Delivery date has been pushed back twice and is now slated for 9/21 without an explanation.

The printer is 1 month old.Tried to do 2 sided printing on a PDF.It printed one side and the screen message indicated to open the tray 1 drawer.when I opened the door (very first opening) it was askew - crooked on the left side.I carefully looked at the interior of teh left side - the door hinge was not through the metal pin.when I closed the door - a pop was heard and several small plastic parts fell to the floor. Photo 1 - are the broken parts found in the doorPhoto 2 - Is the right side - looks correct the door hinge is on the hinge pin.Phot 3- Is the left side - the door hinge (white plastic) is not on the hinge pin. This appears to be an original assembly issue.How do I get warantee help?I looked at HP's site - This does not appear to be a customer change part. Help please.

 My Envy 17's  left hinge has come adrift and is causing the case to separate.There are no loose plastic pieces in the case or fan issues yet.We are leaving the top open; it is no longer a portable laptop. Through searching I have learned this is a common and long time issue starting with prior laptops models.This premuim and expensive latop is just over 2 years old and has been kindly treated; never dropped.I have been a long time HP customer. Today I spent over 30 minutes & 2 phone calls with HP Techical and Customer service ultimately being 'dropped' both times during transfers. I'm hoping this forum's moderators will do better. Yes, the laptop is no longer under warranty but this is a long term well known design weakness.I expect to hear from HP with a  no-cost to me repair solution.Per HP's motto they are ""Here to keep you happy; And your PC, too"" I will provide updates to this issue.

Where/How can we get parts to fix/rebuild the cartridge holdown Clip Either the full assembly or just the hinge part ( the one with the broken off Stub) I've been canibalizing Others ( stripped gears from users pulling paper thru) to fix some but need more hinges. Simple design of a cutout or panel in the case as done for the Ctdg replament would have saved me 20min per. guess that doesnt add to the bottom line. Would have been a simple Alum or other metal cast for that part saved a lot of headaches.

I have the same problem with hp J6480. I have only 1 little plastic point broken off the right side hinge.  I can't understand why customers can't get parts for the hinge and put it on.  Guess hp is hoping to make more $ off its customers.  The hinge doesn't seem to be that difficult to replace.  Now it won't even print a test page.  This is sorry business that customers can't replace something simple.  If I buy another printer, it will likely be a different brand.

HP OfficeJet J6480 All-in-One Printer--Windows 10--64 bitMy printer screen says--door open, close door to print cartridge area. It has the ! light blinking. Pushing cancel or ok will not stop this. I think I may have broken something in the hinge area.  The whole top will not hold itself up.  It would fall off the back if not for 2 ribbon thingys and if I did not hold it. I have wasted time looking on this site for info and a number to talk to a tech or parts person at HP.  I hope someone here may give me some info on this problem.

Hello all,I purchased an HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop about two and a half years ago (which means that sadly, yes, my laptop is out of its factory warranty), and after daily use through school and attempting to find work, the hinge has almost completely broken. I do not close the laptop anymore out of fear that the screen (or anything else, really) will break. I have taken the utmost care of this laptop--carrying it in its own bag, being as gentle as possible with it, and I have never dropped it or anything like that, and the hinge all of a sudden just made a loud noise upon closing the computer. This has been an issue for about a month, and now the bezel has started to peel away from the screen, which is worrying me even more. After some digging, it seems like this is a very, very common problem for this model, and that is absolutely outrageous.I am even more upset about this problem given that I had to send this computer back to HP as soon as I received it about three times before my original issue was correctly diagnosed and fixed. My original issue: upon receiving this computer, it would work for a handful of days, then the hard drive would corrupt itself, leading me to wipe the drive entirely and reinstall Windows many times. It took HP support around three different attempts to actually fix this. And when they finally sent it back with a working hard drive, one of the fans was making a loud grinding noise it had never made before, and I had to replace it on my own since I did not want to send the computer back for a fourth time. I was furious originally, but I was just glad to get my computer in time for school once it was finally fixed for good so my anger faded. But now that another issue has arisen, my anger from that situation is flooding back. After paying upwards of $1000 for a product, I should not be met with so many issues upon receiving it and after treating it like it's my baby for the last two years (I say two now instead of two and a half, since that's how long I've been using it as a daily driver, considering I had to send it back to HP so many times upon initially receiving it).I would love to talk to an HP Support representative regarding my laptop and getting this repaired, as I am not confident in handling this big of a repair on my own, and frankly, I should not have to if this is some kind of manufacturing defect, which it seems to be.I hope all of you reading this have been staying safe during COVID and continue to stay safe going forward. Have a great day, all.Zack

Hopefully I can receive some help as well.  The arm screen hinges on my HP Envy m6 on both sides have completely removed themselves out of the bottom casing.  The laptop has not been dropped or slammed. The problem started small, but worsened over time from what I'm assuming is because of just opening and closing the laptop screen. Luckily my screen is still intact, but I cannot close my laptop completely.  I purchased this laptop some time ago, so it's well and out of warranty for sure, but I would like to inquire on information about an official repair. I have priced computer repair shops around me, but they seem to only offer temporary solutions, such as gluing the hinges back into the casing.  Because of this being a common problem amoungst Envy users, what solutions does HP offer to me with the computer's warranty being expired? I too, look forward to your response and thank you in advanced.R. Williams

The left hinge has had a noisy snap when the computer was closed for some time. (I thought the case was warped from leaning my elbow on it.) But after the fan started rattling then quit working, I took the bottom panel off and discovered lots of small black plastic pieces, one of which had jammed the fan. The plastic pieces are from the hinge -- broken off from where the plastic has failed to hold the grommets. The hinge is so stiff it will barely move. The right hinge has some of the same damage as well.

I have had a problem with the left hinge on my computer (purchased Dec. 2013) for at least a year or more. It wasn't a big deal, until I just yesterday took it to Best Buy's Geek Squad and the tech that tried to fix it made it worse. Now, the bottom panel is somewhat separated from the top panel and it doesn't click closed anymore. The tech told me something was broken and it was not fixable. It isn't under HP warranty anymore. Is this fixable or do I need to replace it?

The tray holding the paper is closed but the screen doesn't allow printing.  it just says to close the tray.  We pulled the tray completely out and it looks like a piece way at the back is broken off.  Suspect that there is a sensor that isn't being hit which will not allow the printer to proceed with printing, scanning, etc. etc. Is there a work around for this issue?

When I opened my laptop this morning, there was a sudden crack of plastic snapping, the right hinge to my display broke, and a short wide screw fell out. Looking on these boards, it sounds like other people have experienced this issue as well. The warranty expired literally 11 days ago so I wasn't able to figure out how to contact support directly on this, and am just hoping I can get in touch with someone from HP support on here to help me look into this. Thank you.

Evny x360 15m-bp111dxThe left hinge on my computer broke .  It stays at my desk and have never dropped it nor abused it.  Went to close it one day and it wouldn't close. In doing many searches, I see this is a common problem and a design flaw  with this laptop. I went to a local repair place and they say it would cost approx $300.00 to fix it!  I am still making payments on this computer.This is a rediculous situation especially with it being a design flaw and not my mishandeling!  What will you do about this issue?

On 07/03, I went to open my laptop and heard a loud crack on the left of the laptop, as I opened it I noticed the screen was detaching from the case around where the hinge holds it together. I'm not sure if this is a hinge issue or something else. Despite not even using the 360 function often (probably once a year) nor dropping or placing any weight on the laptop, I was surprised this happened. Having done a quick search on the forum/Google, it appears to be a common issue. I did purchase my laptop in Mar-2017, so I understand it has been a while, however, this is not what you would expect from a laptop that has had minimal use (it is my personal laptop, I use my work laptop daily).   I contacted HP and was initially quoted  between £2-300 to fix this, I'm not sure why HP are charging such an excessive fee for what may be a little hinge - the screen is perfect (no cracks, no marks). I spoke to a HP member of staff who suggested the fault may have been caused by damage and as it is no longer in warranty I am expected to pay for the repair.  Here are some links to suggest it is clearly not my fault, and it appears to be a manufacturing fault:1. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/td-p...2. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p... 3. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-x360-broken-left-hinge/... 4. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Hinge-Broken/td-p... 5. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-on-HP-Envy-x360/t...  I can go on, but it's clear this is a common issue.10-03 I received (and missed) a call back today from a supervisor, I called back to be told I can't speak to them directly but I would have to pay for the cost. This is extremely disappointing, owning 4 HP laptops (2 Envy, 2 Elitebook) in my household already with my most recent purchase just in Nov-20, I was expecting better service by staff. This has left me with a sour taste, having been a long term HP customer, this sadly may be my last purchase. I would be interested to know what advice others give to get this issue resolved? Of course, I do not want to pay as firstly it appears to be a manufacturing fault, and secondly we in the UK have 6 years cover for electrical goods (Consumer Rights Act 2015), and am surprised by HP's stance on the matter.

Hello, I have had my HP Envy for about three years now,  and when I just opened it I found a small black piece had broken off and that the left hinge is popping. I am super careful with my laptop, so I'm not quite sure how this happened. I would really appreciate assistance with this, since I am now nervous when it comes time to shut it after each session, and I do not want to bend the screen back too far in fear of it breaking off completely. I do not want my laptop to be further damaged. Thank you!

I purchased a $1100 envy360 in 2018. The laptop is now two years old so it’s a year out of warranty. I was using it last night and the left side hinge broke from the inside out. I called hp and they said because it’s out of warranty I would have to pay $500 to have it fixed which would take over a month. I am a college student I don’t have $500 or a month to get my laptop fixed. I told the person on the phone that tons of other people have this same issue so it’s obviously a quality issue. I have NEVER dropped it. I’m so disappointed that HP won’t stand behind their products and do the right thing and fix it for free. The laptop should last longer than two years before it starts to fall apart. I’ve asked them to have a manager call me.

I have purchased two 17"" laptops.  The first had a left hinge that gave way.. Duct tape was a short term fix.The second I purchased with an apparent better hinge reinforced all the way across the back of the laptop.The right hinge gave way.  I was fooled in thinking HP corrected a flawed design.  I question the ethics or lack of same when I peruse customer complaints where no support is given by HP.  I am confident that the breakage is not the fault of the users.

I've had my pavilion gaming laptop for about a year and a few months. But one day after work I went to close my laptop to hear some plastic cracking/breaking sounds. Opening it back up and closing it again, the cracking sounds continued and some tiny screws fell out of the hinge corner that is cracking open. It looks like screws connecting the metal hinge to the screen has broken from their mounts and when closing the screen the hinge is cracking the plastic open. I've left the screen in a permanent open position to try to limit the damage, but when the screen is closed it's crooked. I'm very afraid it will cause screen to break or cause even worse damage. Does anyone have any experience with this issue and fixing it? I'm unfortunately out of warranty by a few months.

If you start looking a lot of people have the same problem with the hinges causing breaking screens. Avoid closing the lap top as much as possible. My problem was after the warrenty but HP are refusing to admit that this is a design fault despite so many people having the same problem. In fact when I reported the problem in the summer, hp said that they was not aware of this problem. Instead of the computer bag that they offered me I asked them to ensure that my problem was recorded in the records in case others have the same problem. Our screen has now got so much worse so I will be contacting them again. I am currently collating a list of others that are experiencing the same problem so they can not tell me the problem does not exist. Best of luck that it will get sorted for you.

About 2 weeks ago i noticed that the right hinge of my laptop was loose and until now its just after getting worse, the bezel is coming off, the other hinge also came off so the  screen is disconnected from the keyboard (although i can still use it), and just recently there is a thick, black vertical line on the left side of the screen with blue and purple lines through it which also partially go away if i put pressure on it . I was wondering what would a good estimate for the fixing price be or would it be better to just get a new laptop. I'm sorta disappointed as i purchased this not too long ago in October but i guess there isn't much to be done now.  Any Help will be appreciated, Thanks! Product Name = HP Pavilion Laptop 14-ce0xxxPurchased from: Currys PC World

Hi all.  I know there have been numerous issues with the HP Envy line with broken hinges.  I have the HP Envy x360 15t.  Left hinge is broken.  Screen is not cracked as of yet.  I am just trying to figure out if it is just the top cover I need to purchase or if there is another part.  The silver plastic piece on the front bezel to the left of the hinge is loose/broken as well.  See pics. If you buy a new top cover, is that part of it, or do you have to purchase a whole new screen if that front lower bezel piece is broken? If so, can any assist with what parts to purchase? HP rep:  This is a question to others users in the community, not to HP itself.  From the number of hinge issues, it is not something you all have addressed in any reasonable manner, and from what I have seen,  charge a fortune to repair if no longer under warranty (which mine is not).  No need for an HP rep to reply.

Hello,    I am the original owner of a HP 4000N.  It has been sitting about 2 years unused.  I went to use it and got some kind of error that I did not record.  Went to pull the towner out and it felt stuck.  So I pulled harder, the toner came out but dumped toner all over the inside.  Ordered ne cartridge.  Cleaned up the toner inside quite a bit,  Put in new toner cartridge went to ready, Yay I thought. Only prints blank pages, actually I guess that's not really printing.  Removed ethernet from printer, shut down, removed ethernet interface, turned on, went to ready.  Pushed the printer engine test button and am getting blank pages. What's next?

My laptop casing broke off (he said it was the clip that broke off) and I brought it to a repair store and they said I’d have to send it to hp but I can’t find anywhere to do that. The contact us button isn’t even a link I’ve been at it for the past two hours. I just want to know how much it would cost to send it in and replace the case.

Hi, I've tried to reach out to HP support on WhatsApp but gets no reply except for the automatic replies that it is the official HP support... I don't know if this is the only or correct way to reach HP support but I hope to get help or guidance.The laptop was bought from HP Sweden in October 2019 meaning it's within the by law stipulated 2 year warranty and the purchase also includes a 3 years service period (with free pick up and return). The issue is related to the hinge for the display and the plastic around being broken making it difficult to open and close the laptop. We've used it very carefully on a table or on the lap sitting in the sofa, so we were very surprised when the problem occured. As advised here above, I searched for hinge issues: now I'm even more concerned as these issues don't seem to be that rare and that it's linked to a weak design but still not all get adequate help (or a forced to pay for repair). Thanks in advance,Britta

Hello, I have an HP ENVY TouchSmart M7-j010dx, and the hinge on the left side has broken loose and has made the plastic casing bulge upward everytime the laptop is opened.  I see this is a common problem for this product line. How can I have this repaired?

Ok, so about a month ago I made a post in HP support about my computer having a broken hinge. A member of the HP support team reached out to me and said I had a few options for going about this. Option 1 I pay $300 dollars to send my computer in and get the hinge replaced. Option 2, I receive a $250 value to the HP store to purchase an new unit. However when I contacted the support member about what I wanted to do, they did not respond. I then made the same post and was told to reach out to the HP phone support team, but when I try to talk to them I'm directed back to the HP virtual assistant, and if I want to actually talk to someone I get charged a fee. I would like to talk to someone on the HP support team over the phone but apparently that's a near impossible task. Please help me.

Hi, My omen laptop has had a terrible issue with the hinges. they started by being really stiff each time i opened and closed the screen, until it becames so bad it eventually cracked the main case.The worst part is that the screen case is now broken and i cannot decently use my laptop.I have contacted the local HP third party customer service where i live and they were unable to give me a solution. I am really upset and i feel like a complete idiot for having bought this computer, given that i found so many threads on the same subject.

My hinge broke on my 15 month old Envy 360 and the screen around it cracked. . This is a known issue but I can’t contact anyone for support or help. There are no emails or phone numbers available to contact a human. I really need this laptop to be working. Rn I can’t even close it! Does anyone have contact information that doesn’t involve me spending hundreds of dollars on a support subscription?!?! I’m a broke college student!

I have an HP Envy 17-inch laptop.  Out of nowhere today I noticed that the left-side hinge is loose/broken and the front and back are separating from each other on that side.  The system still operates and there doesn't appear to be any damage to the display itself.  Is there a fix for this?  Out of warranty.  Thank you

 I bought an HP Envy x360 Convertible 15m-ed0xx for my wife back in September 2020. It's been a pretty solid machine until last night. She went to close it and the right hinge popped. I'm sure it's out of warranty but is it possible to get this fixed? This laptop hasn't not been dropped or mistreated in any way. There seems to be a loose screw in there too. As you can see, the laptop can no longer be closed at all so any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I have a HP Envy 15, and had originally gotten a warranty. My hinge broke while under warranty, so I shipped it to HP to fix it for me. However, it broke again, and my warranty is now expired. Since a lot of people have had issues with breaking hinges with no misuse, and HP has already fixed my computer once, is HP doing anything for those who bought these faulty laptops?

I was given an HP Deskjet 5650. It appears to function, but the latches that hold the ink cartridges in place have broken. They snap off close to the hinge. Does anyone know whether it's possible to replace the latches, and where to buy them? Also, could you point me to a video or diagram that would help in doing the repair?

HiI have strange problem with CP5525, I need to replace print cartridge but I cannot open the front door. I can move the front door only about 4-5 cm (measured at top side) and then it stops. I have experience with many HP printers, and the front doors always open without using any strong force. I have here also CP3525dn, which looks very similar (except it is only A4) and it is extremly easy to open front doors, no force needed.One time I had similar problem with HP LaserJet CM2320fxi. In that case, front door couldn’t open as well (but it moves much more, probably to half of the distance) it stuck at half and when I used more force, the plastic hinge broken. Then, obviously, front door did open but I couldn't get out the cartridge slot, so it had to go to service and they told us, that it is not worth to repair. In that case it was old printer which had many other problems, so it was not that much of a problem.But in case of CP5525, it is very expensive printer and only A3 printer here, so this time, I want to be much more careful. And one strange thing, first time I want to check toners was, when I noticed, that it is some problem with printing blue color. So I did the internal print quality check and noticed, that paper number 3 which supposed to be all blue is completely white except of couple of squares and lines, also one page should by half yellow half green but both was completely yellow. So in the manual, it stated that in this case, it should be a problem with cyan cartridge. Then when I want to check the cyan cartridge, I realize, that I cannot open the front door. I don’t know if it can cause the front door stuck, or if this two issues are somehow connected, but I rather mention it.Also I have to point out, that this is first time I wanted to open the front door on this particular printer, so I don’t know if it is normal for this printer, that the front door is so hard to open.So please, can you help me, what can I do with it? If it can be something wrong with the printer, that prevent the front door to open?Thank you

The right hinge has detached from the plate that it screws into behind the screen. The plastic plate has broken and the threads from which the screws on the hinge should go into are stripped. There are places to buy the hinge, but I really need the part number for the plastic plate that the hinge screws into.

Hi. We got an HP Envy x360 13"" via the online shop. It was delivered July 29, 2020, which means it still is under warranty. We got it while in the US. We're here now in the Philippines where the unit is being used by my daughter for her online classes. It has never left the house since we got here, it has never been taken outside as all schools here are only doing online classes because of the Covid19 situation. The hinge on the right side broke. We brought it to the HP Service Center where they told us they'd inspect it and determine what parts need to be replaced. They also told us that  if parts needed aren't available locally then they'd source outside the country. Now, we got a message from them saying that they can't repair the unit as the part needed for the unit isn't supported here and that it needs to be returned to the country of  origin, and that we can get it from them now. Is this what  HP service is? We're left to our own resources to have this unit fixed. Checking the community forum, it appears that this issue with Envy x360 hinge is widespread. I'm hoping HP can solve our problem.

Computer screen broke when opened because the hinge pulled out and every time you move it breaks a little more!!! This is terrible!! Called a repair shop and told them what happened didn’t ever tell them what brand I had but they told me what it was because he sees it all the time! Terrible terrible to have this happen as this was not a cheap computer!! To say that I am unhappy is putting it mildly!!

Hi, my laptops hinge has recently broken. this is through no fault of my own as i believe, as i never move my laptop, and i have left it open for the last 2 days due to myself being scared of opening/closing the lid as it makes a horrible clicking sound along with the hinge detaching from the bottom left corner of the screen. my laptop is working fine except the hinge. i have read through the other discussions and found out that most people that bought their laptops 3-4 years ago are experiencing this, my laptop was bought in 2013. I tried to superglue the screws together as i do not have the time to get my laptop fixed or even afford to fix it right now, as i know HP will try to charge me a ridiculous amount for such a tiny job as i am a student and have exams in 2 months. What do i do? i would fix the part myself but i cannot find any replacement parts for my laptop. I believe this is not fair for me as i did not even drop the laptop or even moved it around much as i am always doing work on my desk. My battery doesnt even lock on the same side of the hinge that broke, thats how out of place it is.

The hinge on my HP pavilion gaming 15-cx0056wm laptop has broken and the bezel has cracked after 10 months of use. I have not dropped the pc or put it under undue stress. I have only opened and closed it. HP support said the could fix it for $400, since this is a $600 pc I think that is silly. I've seen other people with this problem so it seems like a manufacturing error. How should I fix this?

My HP Pavillion Gaming laptop started showing cracks just some 9 months after I bought. The bezel was slowly peeling off and now its completely broken. I did not expect this to happen and that's why I never checked it when it was under warranty as well. The back hinge is now broken. I just don't understand how something like this that really seems to be a defect in the laptop design. I see many people have faced this issue and I don't understand why its been designed like this as well?? My warranty has now expired. Where can I get this repaired and how much will it cost?I know from searching this site that I am not alone with this same problem. Isn't there anything that HP can do to repair this ?

Hello, I reached out to the support community about a year ago, for a broken hinge on the left side of my HP Envy x360. An HP escalation executive reached out to me, and we were able to resolve my issue free of cost once I had sent in pictures of my laptop. I would like to point out, that the laptop was less than 1.5 years old at the time, I had not done anything to it, and my previous 2-3 HP laptops also had broken left hinges. In my previous post, I also mentioned how my sister bought an HP Envy x360, two weeks after I bought mine. Similarly, two weeks after my laptop screen came apart, hers started breaking apart too. Now this was shocking as she keeps her laptop on her desk all day, and doesn't even take it to school as I do mine daily. The fact that her laptop started falling apart at the same timeline as my own, and that previous our previous HP laptops also broke with the left hinge, makes me think this may be a hardware issue on the fault of the company. Now, we have been reaching out to HP since October/November 2019, and have constantly been given unsatisfactory solutions. First, we were told to call HP, which costs a decent amount of money that did not seem plausible for a hardware issue. 6 months later, we reached out again, to which the person we spoke with was a different individual who keep ignoring my questions, and at most offered us a 35% discount without even asking for pictures.  This was highly disappointing as my laptop was repaired for free, AFTER the executive had seen the pictures. Secondly, it was to no fault of our own that the laptops began to fall apart, as mentioned before my sister does not even move her laptop from her desk to her bed, so how did her screen start breaking apart? Thirdly, I would be willing to pay a bit to get it fixed, but it is highly disappointing as we paid over $1000 for the laptop, and within the span of a month gave this company $2500 of our business, and much more over the last 12 years. As well as, my sister is in high school and I am a university student, we cannot afford to pay +$300 for repairs when we spent $1200 on the laptop itself, individually. As for ignoring the question, the individual wouldn't answer why mine was repaired for free, why I couldn't speak to the executive as before, and why he wasn't even asking to see the condition of the laptop. He had also mentioned that my sister's laptop was out of warranty and thus cannot be repaired for free. But when we first reached out it had only been out of warranty for 3 months, and mine was also out of warranty, yet it was still repaired free of charge. Now it's obviously been much longer, but only because we haven't been able to come to an agreeable solution. I am upset and disappointed with HP for the lack of clear communication and understanding, I am open to any suggestions on how to repair this laptop with low cost, or any other ways I can reach out to HP and speak with as escalation executive as I hope they will be more understanding. Any suggestions are appreciated and welcome. Thank you.

I have an HP ENVY x360 with a broken left hinge. I have had my laptop for LESS than 2 years, and the broken hinge has progressively gotten worse with pieces of the hardware breaking off and I am also now unable to close my laptop at all.  At first I thought it was something I may have done, as my previous HP laptop had also broken from the left hinge (however I was still able to use it for 6 years through multiple repairs, but it was also only a fraction of the price of an HP ENVY x360). However, my sister bought her HP ENVY x360 on the exact same as I did. Her left hinge began to loosen a week after mine did. She keeps her HP ENVY x360 on her desk at all times.  With both our left hinges breaking, and my previous HP laptop left hinge breaking, I'm beginning to think it's a manufacturing issue. I have no idea what I should do to fix it, where I can take it, and I am beyond upset if I have to pay a tremendous amount (which I could use for a cheaper laptop that'll last me longer) to fix this issue, when this laptop itself already cost more than $1200.  As a university student working minimum wage, I cannot afford to pay high amounts to fix this laptop. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should do or where I can take it? I'm at a total loss.  P.s. I'd like to get my laptop fixed before the beginning of September as I need it to take notes in class and do my assignments. Much appreciation for anyone that can help! Thank you!

TLDR; I think my laptop hinge or corner of my screen has broken on its own accord. How do I get it fixed? This morning when I opened my laptop, I heard some clicking sounds and found:1. The bottom right corner of my screen had popped out slightly.2. The right hinge wasn't level with the left hinge.3. The bottom right corner of my screen is slightly discoloured and has tiny bubbles.4. I can't move my screen over 120 degrees because my screen bends so much that I fear that it'll break. Yesterday, my laptop was fine (I could bend and close it perfectly ).My laptop NEVER leaves my desk unless I need to print something (which is rarely). I honestly haven't been rough with it or done anything that might cause this to happen. Certainly nothing to warrant the screen to come apart. I can't believe it's broken! I know my 3 year warranty period hasn't ended yet. How can I get this issue fixed ASAP? I'm starting uni next month and I can't be using a faulty laptop. I also can not afford to buy a new laptop right now. I'm quite desperate. Please help me.

I have an HP 250 G6 – I needed to replace a broken rear screen cover, broken cable and screen cable, broken left hinge and both hinge covers.I can’t manage to figure out where to put the screen cable and wifi cable in the left side hinge cover, without damaging them when I put on the bottom cover - which also deosn;t fit becasue the cables are in these way!A You-tube link or clear simple step by step instructions to sort out the screen and wifi cable through the left hinge and hinge cover and onto the motherboard would be very helpful.Thank you,Philip

The 2 hinges broke on my hp envy x360. You can still see the cheap plastic on the screws suggesting awful product design. I’ve seen many other posts like mine. Should HP cover the cost of the repair? I still don’t know if it might have damaged my screen has the hinges popped on the screen side and separated it from the top cover. The laptop was never dropped and barely moved trough its whole lifespan. For a product that expensive, the hardware shouldn’t be breaking under 3 years.

Had this device for about a year and a half.  The display hinge has gradually started failing, with first the glue separating between the display plastic surround, and here in the last few days the hinge beginning to wrench itself off.  No physical damage to the device, average daily usage of a couple hours.  Any options here?  Assuming the device is out of warranty, unfortunate a $1k laptop would break after such a short period of time. Have used HP devices for decades - they've always been well made.  Surprised to see the lower quality plastic and thin metal construction here failing so early...previous device lasted a decade and still has no issues.   Similar to other posts here and on the web:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Software-and-How-To-Questions/HP-Pavilion-Gaming-15-Hinge-Bro...

Dear Sir/MaamM Hinge of my laptop was broken in October 2018 for which I contact the hp team as the laptop was in warranty. They then sent an engineer after a month to check the issue who handled the laptop very badly. He took off a few things and places them back taking pictures but in the whole process he broke the screen. I told him the thing immediately and he assured me that it will be done in warranty. He then left and they kept me waiting for 4 months and suddenly last month they reject my case stating that hi he breakdown is not covered under warranty but no one is now paying attention to the screen the engineer broke himself. I even contacted your team through WhatsApp but they will simply ignore the screen part and reply with hinge is not covered in warranty. Okay, I will get the hinge repaired all by myself but what about the screen your engineer broke. I am not able to use the laptop from past 4 months . I have been talking to so many people but not getting any positive response. Please help me with this case, I already suffered a lot because of this.

I have the same problem. So far, the replies have been nonsense. What is with this one. Redirect the OP to Microsoft forums then ask if that solved the problem. Purlease. Is that a joke reply.?

My computer was purchased about a year ago. Only recently I have been unable to close and open my laptop.  The trim around my screen was pulled off by half of my left plastic hinge, the bottom half. The hinge is in great condition and will even clip back on, but the issue is internally. I don't know how to fix this. I am unable to open or close the lid for because of the broken connection on the left side, my plastic bottom hinge will not move, thus tearing my trim off the lid when I try to open or close.

The hinge on the back of my laptop is broken and cannot close properly. Can this be fixed? Also, I keep receiving a message when I start up the computer that the battery needs to be replaced, can I do this as well?

Hello, similar to the numerous descriptions listed on here under the same subject line, my HP Envy x360 15” lower right hinge separated from the screen this morning (side note: I spent at least a month looking into various brands and models specifically to avoid such a problem. HP has always been good to me with its desktop and laptop design, so I thought the Envy x360 would also be highly reliable.). It appears that two screws fell out, along with small bits of plastic - from what I can see, the plastic crumbs seem to be from the laptop cover, behind the screen. This was due to faulty hardware, not mishandling. While the laptop is out of warranty at this point, I see from other postings, that HP has recognized the design flaw and is willing to replace this at no cost. Please provide me with the contact information necessary to begin the repair process, and replace the flimsy plastic with a more durable material. Thank you!

I own a HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx and i have been using it for over a year and a half now. However for the last month, i have noticed difficulty opening and closing the laptop and after searching carefully, i found out that the hinge is broken and some portion of the hinge looks exposed and some portions of the screen case looks a bit exposed also. I have never dropped the laptop and never caused any physical damage to the laptop due to negligence. My question is, will warranty cover the repair of the broken hinge and exposed screen case and if not, how much would it cost (out of pocket)  to repair it?  Thanks

The plastic around the hinge has popped open and does not pop back into place, I have tried to tape the casing closed but didn't hold for long. Some pieces of plastics have broken off internally from attempting to open and close, I now just leave it open. The frame is also coming away from the screen. Would I be able to replace the body of the laptop or will I need to send it off to be replaced? This laptop has been used daily for the last four years so I believe this is the reason for the body coming apart

I have been using my laptop for 2 years. I really need it for school and about a month ago the bottom right corner of the screen popped out. At first it was fine I just had to pop it back in but now it makes a terrible cracking noise when I try to close it so I've just been keeping it open. I dont want to have to bring it back to school where I constantly close and open it to transport it to and from classes. I know the hinge is broken but I dont know how to go about fixing it without breaking it more. Help.

The plastic pieces holding my screen in place broke and I am wondering approximately how much it would cost to replace the backing.

Hi,My Laptop is a year and a couple of months old now. One of my laptops hinges is broken. I can't flip the laptop screen because it's gonna break the screen display. There's a screw with plastic pieces that exit the hinge when it break. I success to close the laptop whitout any damage but I am afraid  to open it now. I saw on internet that is a common problem for this model occurring anytime after 10 months of it usage.   Thank you

I've had my laptop for about a year and a half now. I first started to see problems as the front of the screen started peeling away from the plsatic, then the bottom of the screen started popping open. Now all of a sudden one day I tried to close it and the hinge just flat of broke. Sounded like I was crunching gravel as things started to pop out. This is a common issue that I've seen in many other posts that is clearly a design flaw. I'm quite disappointed given HP usually has great quality, yet here my expensive laptop breaks within two years of gentle use.  I've taken great care of it and never have dropped it. But now I can't even close the laptop out of fear It will totally break apart. How come HP hasn't done anything to solve this issue!?!?! Similar feeds:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hinge-broken/m-p/7522794https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Gaming-Notebooks/HP-Gaming-Pavilion-hinge-breaking-after-1-5-years/m-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...

I have an HP Pavilion15 t-cx0000. The camera on it is displaying an error that there is no camera installed:My device manager also indicates that there are no camera drivers installed:  My laptop was working perfectly fine a month ago, and then I sent it to HP for a hinge repair and they updated BIOS while it was there. I think that may be the cause of the issue. I can't find the drivers anywhere. It worked for about 15 minutes a week ago and reflected the HP Wide Vision HD Camera driver version 10.0.18362.693, which was up to date. I rebooted and attempted to use the camera the following day, and the driver was gone. I have tried recovering from an external hard drive, doing a Reset and reinstalling Windows 10, and nothing is working.  Please help me get my webcam back.

I am the owner of an HP ENVY Laptop 13 --Product Number: 8MX92AVTo give you context, it has never been dropped and nothing's every been spilled on it.  This laptop does not leave my office--literally.  It came apart all on it's own! Last week, the rear hinge on my laptop separated so that every time I opened it, the right hinge stuck out.  So in order to close it, I had to manually adjust the hinge to properly close it.  It thereby made a distinct ""clicking"" sound each time I opened or closed the laptop.  I also noticed the lower right corner where the screen is mounted began to separate as it was becoming unglued.  All of these problems originated on the right side of the laptop.   Within 48 hours, opening it gently, my screen detached from the frame and split!  I am at a total loss as to what to do.  I'm currently using my backup 17.3 HP G72 which is well over a decade old and has never given me a single issue.  I purchased this laptop in September 2020 and it is now worthless.  Please help HP!  I'm a loyal customer and I love my computer.

My husbands laptop hinge is broken and has caused the corner of his screen to pop out and can’t be closed.  Is there anything we can do to fix this. Repair shop wants 200+ which seems ridiculous. He is in the military and uses this for college. It’s very disappointing considering what we payed for it and how little it’s been used. I’m not sure of exact model atm but it’s touch’s Rene that can be folded to use in tablet mode.

Hi, I'd just like to know what the key hinge model is for the HP OMEN 15-ek0000. Some of my keys have been broken and I'd like to get them repaired manually, however, there is no guide that I could find; can someone either direct me to a guide or tell me the key hinge model? Thank you in advance.

Hope this gets to Jeff.  My computer is out of warranty, but I too have a broken hinge.  I can't afford to buy a new laptop after just 2 years,  The hinge started giving me trouble very quickly, but I had no idea it would just continue to get worse!  If anyone could tell me how to contact Jeff that would be wonderful.  He seems to be the only one willing to help.  Thanks so much!

So i have this HP Pavilion Gaming 16-a0023nw for about a year and my Q button's hinges broke. I don't know how to fix that,  button is moving very freely and it pisses me off. It's actually very important to me because I'm a gamer and I use this button almost all the time.

So I previously posted about help and got no where with HP. Several other people reached out to ask if I had found a solution. and since I finally did I wanted to update the thread. Luckily, my sister builds electronic components for a living so I made her do the repair but after watching her I'm sure anyone else could. She used a tool to pop my plastic frame from around my screen off to diagnose what was going on. It wasn't hard to pull apart but she used a separator tool to make sure the plastic tabs didn't break. Only 1 screw was used on each side of the metal hinge. The other screws used were screwed into thin plastic that couldn't handle the tension of the lid being pulled open and all had broken away from the plastic. The hinges themselves were over tightened during assembly. She said when the parts are assembled there is a calibrated drill they are suppose to use to tightened things like screws and hinges so this doesn't happen. She said it was either not calibrated correctly or the person didn't use the tool at all and used a hand tool. Either way a bunch of fumbles on HP's end is absolutely causing this problem. So the fix... its not ideal but it works. Since the plastic screws were not salvageable the only way to relieve the pressure was to loose the hinges. There is a very thin line of tension the screen can handle before the frame wants to pop apart and the lid flops open and close too freely. She had to repeatedly tighten and test the tension. She used a pair of needle nose pliers to tighten the end bolt. Then  cut a few strips of black electrical tape and ran them vertically down and around the frame on the outermost side of the hinge to reinforce the lid from wanting to separate. Not great I know but now my laptop is usable again.

Around 2 years after purchasing my OMEN, the part of the right hinge inside of the chassis attached to the screen broke off, and popped off. The warranty ran out a year ago and it seems a lot of people are having this same issue. However, after spending hours calling HP it seems that there is nothing they can do for me without charging me an absurd price of £220+. After spending almost £1k on this laptop I am extremely disappointed and I don't think I'll ever buy from HP again. Doesn't seem right to me that I have to pay for a defect, after going through hoops and hours of customer ""support"".

I bought this Laptop in Nov 2019 for my daughter, it has never left the house (mainly sitting on her desk)and has been lightly used, until COVID and home schooling, it was used probably about once a week. It’s out of warranty.A couple of days ago one of the hinges broke, after looking into this I see it’s only made of plastic. Which I can not believe they make a major working part in this way. I have had laptops by other makes and never had this issue. surely this is a design fault? Any views /help as I’m very disappointed in a company that I’ve always had good products from in the past.

The top lid to my OfficeJet 9015 printer will no longer stay open on it's own.  I believe one of the hinges must have a catch that has broken.  I cannot find any information on how to repair it or any parts listing for the hinges.  Can anybody help?

Hello,My HP Pavilion Notebook left hinge broke and the left part is bit cracked and bulging every time I try to open my laptop. The laptop was not dropped or fell. When I open and close the laptop the hinge is shifting and then seperating lower case from the upper case and crack starts increasing from time to time usage. I am not able to close and open the laptop properly as I fear that it would completely destroy my laptop. The warranty is 1 Year, 1 Month on this laptop. Once I Tried Help From Hp Service but did'nt got satisfied service at all.Please help.

I am seeing plenty of this same problem. I have a broken left hinge. I want to know if the part number 832356-001 is the correct hinge I am not happy with the laptop it is falling apart and not very old. I also need to know if I can get a pdf of all the parts in a visual format. It is out of warrenty and I will have to fix it myself. I am very unhappy with this laptop and so are a lot of other people on this forum!!!

Hello ,I am not able to close my laptop at all because the hinge is broken and it tears down the bezel along with it as a result i should keep my monitor stationary with some support behind to hold it steady.I am unable to carry my laptop anywhere as i cannot close it and it damages every time if tried to do so.So i need help as how to proceed ,can it be repaired without any replacement or needs to be changed as a whole set? If so how much will be the cost in either case?Thanks

Okay first and foremost this started with a simple screen replacement and hinge replacement which quickly had turned into so much frustration I am feeling quite defeated. The ribbon cable came loose from it's solder point on the touchpad board , so I being cheap tried to resolder the original cable and succeeded only to find it's now barely.. literally barely too short to reach the connector a week later and 20$ less in my account I spliced it with silver conductive epoxy and have it reconnected I'm feeling a little better about the situation and I'm putting the laptop back together, the pain in the ass it is and it's tight nooks and crannies, I hear a strange ping and my heart drops as I discover two prongs have broken loose in what I guess would be a middle point of the wire inside a small plastic black cube on the motherboard itself I have no clue what this component is and I'm at my end with this endeavor if anyone could please identify this for my knowledge and possible next course of action.

This question has appeared a few times on this site already (it seems like a common issue), so I wanted to open it again. I've had this laptop for around 2-3 years, and sadly my warranty expired after only 1 year. A few months ago whilst closing my laptop I heard a loud crack and a two screws popped out of my laptop, which appeared to be holding the screen onto the hinges. After carefully opening my laptop again (and keeping it permanently open to avoid further damage), I continued to use it as normal, since I'm at university and it contains all of my work. I contacted HP customer support to see how much it was to repair these hinges and they said it would cost £314!After some protest they were willing to offer the same service for £220, but this still seems ridiculous for a laptop that cost me around £600, and was damaged not by carelessness but by simply CLOSING the laptop. Since then, the screen has begin to suffer from glitches and colour issues, which has made the laptop increasingly difficult to use, but I can't really afford to throw £220 at a laptop I already bought outright, just for this problem to emerge again in a couple years time. From what I understand, this is an INCREDIBLY common issue with this type of laptop.The user @Huershut in this thread: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p...mentioned in 2018 that he managed to get his x360 repaired for free, and I wondered what the conditions of this free repair were, and whether or not such a thing would be available to me and others who experience this issue. Thank you for reading this little rant,sincerely,A worried student

When opening my laptop a few days ago the left hinge crack and the lid has separated. It's currently being held together by a heavy duty binder clip and cannot be closed which means I can't take it any place. My laptop just went out of warranty in May. I've own several HP laptops over the years and nothing like this has ever happened. A bit disappointed in the quality.Regards, Van47

Like the title says, the left hinge on my vr1000 broke apart earlier. My headset is out of warranty so can't go that route. I was curious if I could get the part because the fix seems very simple or see about getting it repaired. I had to post here because there was no direct support contact for my product. Thanks for your help!

My computer's Ethernet port clip has snapped, not the hinge, but the plastic itself has broken. This is the part that bends down to clip the Ethernet cable into the computer.  If I hold the cable in the Ethernet port my computer still receives data through it.  Let me know if you need any more specifics that i haven't thought of.

I bought three HP Envy M7's and two out of three the left hinge has broken. Screens are seperating and you can not close. They are 15 months old, I am disgusted with everyone having the same problem and HP not fixing them or recalling the computers. I will NEVER buy another HP. I need to knw the hinge part so I can fix these cheap but expensive laptops!

I have a HP Pavilion 15-p043cl notebook that has a broken hinge and back cover. I suspect the rod that goes up the back panel snapped and broke through the cover, leading to the broken hinge cover on the bezel. I purchased a new back cover and hinges, but need a new bezel to complete the system. I ordered the bezel listed in parts surfer, but it is apparently for the non-touchscreen version. Can somebody direct me to the bezel that works with the touchscreen version of this notebook? Thank you in advance. Nathan

Good evening. I am the proud owner of a lap top hp omen 17 inches for the last 3 years. Well recently i had a problem with broken hinge , from typical usage. Is there a way to buy the plastic case only?? If you need more information of the product id and etc plz ask me. I am kinda on the edge here.
