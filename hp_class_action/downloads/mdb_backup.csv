My Laptop is a year and a month old now.My laptops hinges are broken. I can hear the cracking sounds of plastic inside body and the P0 phillips broad head screws have started to fall apart. I am afraid closing the laptop lid is going to harm even more. The laptop has never had any kind of physical incidents so it safe to keep it out of the equation.I see this is a common problem for this model occurring anytime after 10 months of it usage.   What is the suggested response to this ? Since this is clearly NOT because of my mis-handling of the laptop. My case is very similar to this post : https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...

The lower left corner of the lid rested against the bottom of the laptop and the screen cracked. I didn't make much effort - I acted as usual. When opening the laptop, there were no features. There are several posts on this forum about this topic. This indicates a constructive and serial problem of this model. Given the high price of the laptop, I expect your company to repair the laptop even though the warranty has expired.

Hello, This morning, I opened my laptop like I normally would do, but this time, I heard a crack-like sound. I immediately turned to the sound and saw that the left hinge of the laptop was broken. I don't take my laptop anywhere, not even to school. It stays on my desk and I never put any weight on it.  The same thing happened to my sister with her laptop - which is the exact same as mine - a few weeks back, and since then, I've been even more cautious about how I treat my laptop. I've only had this for 15 months, just above two years and got it about two weeks after my sister got hers.   I also noticed that two screws came out. I can't close my laptop anymore because it only seems as if it's going to fall apart even more than it already has.  I was wondering how much I'd have to pay to get it fixed, even though I find it unfair that this laptop is basically brand new and it's already falling apart on me.

Several weeks ago I noticed that my laptop's lid was not closing right. The screen would separate during opening and closing so I stopped. Looking inside, I could see that the metal hinge itself was cracked and no longer connected to the lid back. I see that this is a common issue and that an HP representative has gotten in contact with other people who have had the same issue. What can I do to get this fixed?

   Overtime the hinges on my laptop started to separate, causing the computer corners to crack and eventually leading to the hinges to complete failure. The screen is now detached to the point that I can rotate it 360 and only attachment to the computer is via wires. At some point the display stopped powering on and as of now I can only use if attached to a remote display/monitor. Ive checked  wires for abrasions, tears or detachment and see no problems visable. The computer powers on no problem and runs great when attached to a monitor. Do the hinges have a switch to control that would prevent the monitor from powering on if not attached correctly (like a swing arm or something similar ?). Eventually I will correctly replace the hinge kit and ensure monitor is properly affixed but is there a workaround in the meantime to get the monitor on (I would simply prop the screen up from behind with something until properly fixed). Any help or suggestions would be appreciated  HP Notebook - 17-by0063clProduct Number4BW35UA

I bought this HP notebook in September 2020 from HP online website, along with a 3 year Care Pack which expires in September 2023 A few weeks ago the right hinge started to work loose. It now appears to be broken and the case is starting to split apart.  I reported this to HP technical support and they insist it is damage and are quoting £253 for the repair.  The HP Care Pack is an extension of the warranty which states that ""if the product is defective, HP will repair or replace the product or refund the purchase price upon return of the product, at HP's option. I explained that the laptop had not been damaged and that the problem was due to the failure of an internal component - but they still insisted that they view it as damage. I feel strongly that HP are reneging on their responsibilities under their warranty. iIhave since discovered that there have been many thousands of cases where hinges on HP notebooks have failed. It has been demonstrated that this is due to faulty design, and In the US, users are proposing to take a class action lawsuit against HP over this issue. There are also many examples on this forum if you search for ""broken hinge"".Has anyone had this problem and been able to get it fixed under the warranty?

This is the second 17"" HP Laptop we've owned. Both times the hinges failed with very little use, causing the case to separate from the display. Luckily the first one was still under warranty. This one is not. Will HP do anything about this, seeing it's a re-occurring problem ? Have they changed the design, or still have the same ? Because I don't know if I will buy another HP if it's the same. Because, the first one we sent back, they couldn't fix. Thanks.

Up until today, I have enjoyed using my HP Envy x360 Laptop. Like any other day I went to use my laptop and opened it up from the clamshell position. As I opened it up the screen pulled away from the metal casing and hinge resulting in a cracked screen. This laptop has never been dropped or damaged in any way so it is very disappointing for my laptop to be destroyed for simply opening it.  After the screen broke I picked the laptop up and discovered round things that look like a screw sitting on my desk behind the right hinge. I do not understand how the hinge broke in the first place but I believe that is the source of my laptop's misfortune. This seems like a terrible design flaw and unfortunately I am no longer covered by the warranty. The website does not have an option that covers this particular issue but I would definitely like to talk to someone about this problem and get this fixed immediately.

Hi, the right screen hinge on my computer just broke - missing screws, broken plastic, won't rotate, bending my DVD drive, etc. I'm looking to fix it. So far I have been told it would cost the same amount to fix as it would to just buy a new computer since it would include an entire screen replacement. I'm hoping someone here knows a cheaper company, person, method, etc. I could use to fix my laptop. I need it for school and work.

I had brought a hp envy 360 laptop in December 2021. On feb 28th 2022 when I was closing my laptop I heard a cracking sound and when I saw, the left hinge was broken. When I took it for repair, the local professional said this is happening with everyone. After a year just after your warranty gets over, the hinge will break. He advised me to take it to the hp care. The person at hp care said, the replacement of the hinge will be around 15000 INR but if I extend the warranty by paying 16000 INR they will do the repair for free. I smell something fishy as the physical damage is not covered by the warranty. Then I called the customer care to clarify and they said the same thing, physical damage is not covered in warranty. Now when I reached home I found the screen is also broken. This may have happened during my travel. Now they are quoting around 40000 INR for replacement of the screen. I had brought the laptop for 72000 INR and have to pay 40000 INR to get the hinge and screen replaced that too just after 14 months. I don't understand what was my fault. I didn't do anything wrong, however became a victim of dirty business model. Being a middle class Indian guy, it was very difficult for me to arrange the money to buy this laptop and now it will take about 6 more months before I could get 40000 INR to get it repaired. I had a emotional attachment with the laptop. Now for 6 months I won't be able to use the laptop which is another problem. I won't recommend the HP laptop to anyone, ever. HP broke my trust

Update: When getting a case-no. from the shop, I emailed HP and really let them have it and posted it on their FB page. One of their support contacted me and I complained again. Result: I got it fixed and sent it back to me within 11 days and had to pay nothing. They know!  Bought mine Nov 20, same here: the right hinge broke today. I closed it for a lunch break, but the upper part didn’t line up with the base. Opened it up, and screen pieces fell out. I went to the shop where I bought it, and they told me it was a known problem and send it out for repair on a “voluntary warranty”. So, hp must know. It’s probably cheaper to wait if they come back than a recall.

Hello  I have a HP Envy 13-ah0013nn for 14 months, and suddenly when i open it the left hinge together withe frame brake down.This makes me really wonder about the quality of this so called premium laptops.  Is this issue covered by HP warranty? I noticed on forums a lot of people complaining about the same issue but no solution. Even on current forum i noticed that persons witch were complaining about the same issue were contacted  by HP, but no further details about how the issue was solved.As is quite obvious that this product has some factory problems, I am wondering if someone opened market claim or sue HP for it? I look forward to get any helpful feedback. Thank you in advance.

I didn't even put much pressure on my laptop anytime. Now it gives me a feeling like the whole screen will come off on the left side. It's really nothing of my fault. I even never dropped it or done anything to my laptop. Then I googled about the same problem and discovered its really a very common problem with every laptop of this kind.I bought it in the UK and now in India for a short visit and I faced this issue here. Now I got stuck and can't do any office work. I am an IT guy working for TOP Banking company in London, UK and is my laptop is very important for me now. I am very afraid that how can work without my laptop no as I already paid too much for this laptop. it's really very heartbreaking. Could you please help me on this urgent basis?

The left hinge on my laptop has recently broken. There was absolutely no user error (drop, stepped on, etc.) on my end, and it happened after I heard a rather loud crack while opening my laptop.

Hello, From what I can find the hinges on the HP Envy are a defective design, both my upper and lower case are broken from this defective design. It is very disheartening as I purchased an HP on the recommendation of a friend in the IT Business of praised their support and products. I looked up the parts on the HP website and it will cost $175.16 for both the upper and lower sections. I think that it is insane to charge that much money for the parts, a piece of plastic and aluminum, its price gouging and I would need the parts if the hinge was not of a inferior engineering. It seems wrong. Has anybody come up with a better solution that is realistic, the computer is a couple years old but I never expected a hinge to make me have to buy a new one. I made sure to get the best I could afford, it has the nice i5 processor and lots of ram and should be quick and relavant for at least another two to three years, if I have to buy a new computer because of a hinge I would never buy another HP again. Does anybody have an idea how to solve the broken hinge problem without getting taken advantage of and paying $175 for two parts that should cost maybe 60-80 bucks? Any help is appreciated,Thank you

Hiya, I've had this laptop approximately 3-4 years or so and never had any real problems, however about 3/4 of a year ago one of the hinges became quite badly damaged. I normally use my laptop to connect to other monitors so it's never been a significant issue as of yet and I didn't want to fork out for a repair cost (unfortunately, it's no longer under warranty). However my usage is changing and I do need to be more mobile with it. I did a fair bit of Googling and I've noticed a number of people had a similar problem to me, however I didn't manage to find a fix for the problem. Because of the damage I literally cannot move the laptop up or down without fear of it snapping, and even then the hinge is completely out ofn place. I can push it back in - which I do - however it almost instantly pops back out again. Does anyone know what the best idea would be to go about fixing this? Is it a do-it-yourself problem, or would it be best to get it repaired?  Any advice is appreciated. I can also post a picture of the hinge if it's helpful. Cheers,Adam

The back right hinge on my HP Envy 13 wore down after having it for under 6 months. I took very good care of my laptop and there were no drops, dents, breaks, or cracks on it. I read on these forums and elsewhere that this is a very common problem (Especially with the Envy), so I contacted HP to see what they could do on Dec 20 and described the laptop's condition to the representative after which he assured me that it was covered by the warranty and I should send it in. I further stressed that because of school I would need it back by Dec 30th and asked if this would be possible. I was reassured TWICE that it would be available by then so I paid for the shipping and sent it in. A couple days later a get an e-mail telling me that my laptop will be returned by at earliest Jan 5. I contacted HP support and they assured me they would have it expedited. Two days later I received an e-mail that it has been expedited to... Jan 5 still. I contact them again, this rep was actually honest and said there was no guarantees that it could come sooner. Slightly frustrating, but I understand and I made arrangements with my school to rent a laptop for that time period. No sweat. Yesterday, I got an email from HP telling me to contact them about the laptop. Ok, good news right? First rep over messenger tells me they can fix it (great!) but all that I owe $612, and he can' t say why. So I have to call customer support and figure out why. To this point I'm ok with HP, I understand the process and I'm fine with slip ups and mistakes, whatever it happens I get it. This rep confirms for me that I owe $612 for the repairs because she says they are beyond the normal wear and tear. Since this is such a common issue with the laptop, and since it still works fine with no cracks, dents, scratches or missing and broken parts besides the hinge, I am very confused. Unfortunately she cannot explain what exactly the issue is (I understand this is not her department, perfectly reasonable), and then attempts to get me to pay the $612. Now I paid $660 for the entire laptop when it was brand new so it is pretty ridiculous that this is basically the entire price of the laptop for a broken hinge. I stress that I need to speak to the repair center and I'm informed that customer service does not have their contact info and that they will call me. I once again stressed my timeline and asked to please hear ASAP. I was assured that they would be in contact with me very soon. I'm still being patient so I say I'm fine with that, but I'm starting to feel a little mistreated and my patience is definitely being tested. I still haven't heard from HP why I am being charged for nearly the entire price of the computer, and to be honest there is no way I am paying for basically a new computer, especially if I can't even know why I'm being charged that amount. I'm running out of time and honestly think I'm headed to the Apple store if I can't get this sorted out, or at least have HP give me the time of day after I've been so patient. I stopped using Apple laptops after 9 years to try HP because I heard good things and I do like the computer, but this situation has left a very bad taste in my mouth. I just wish HP would take a little time and actually realize how ridiculous this is, especially since they're in danger of losing a customer.

Hello, HP Support Division Heads and CEO.
 
I deeply regret to say that buying a HP laptop  will turn out to be one of my biggest mistake. I never thought that HP would use a LOW Grade material for Hinges that would break on its own within less then 10 months of usage.  I am a student and use my laptop for my projects and researches , i open the lid may be twice a day , and till date have complained the THAT MY HINGES ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY  JUST AFTER 60DAYS OF USAGE , i did get an onsite visit but to no success ,the technician just oiled it lightly with MY  HAIR OIL (in a very unprofessional way)  and left . I complained about it but NO RESPONSE.
 
I CAN SHARE ALL THE CHATS I HAD REGARDING MY HINGES ()
 
Now I have multiple objections to this. I can send you several links available on google and youtube videos, which confims that HP laptops has known issue with Left Hinges.
 
1. So even if you repair it, there are chances that it might break again, due to your poor quality of Hinges. which means there is big expenses waiting if this happens again.
 
2. What's the use of buying an extended Warranty of 2yrs, if these things are not covered within it. ( Now let me clarify, I am not saying that if i drop the laptop or spill coffee over it and then asking you to repair it free of cost. I am asking you because its broken on its own due to poor quality and you have known issue with your hinges)
 
3. A simple hinges broken, its repair procedure requires a good amount of parts replacement Top Cover, Bottom Enclosure and also disassembling the laptop to fix the hinges, This is very painful, no one likes a postmortem on his new laptop. This also leaves a possibility that other parts may get damaged in the process.
 
 
There is only two ways, that could convince me.
1. Either replace your faulty product and give me a new laptop.
OR
2. Take the responsibility of fixing hinges when ever is broken in my 2yrs extended Warranty period free of cost.
by adding me to ADP coverage for my exended period of warranty. ( Remember I am not asking you to do any favour if i drop the laptop or spill coffee over it. )
 
 
This way, i would be relaxed and would not be worring about quality of hinges and what if after fixing it breaks away again on its own.
 
Remember laptop is very expensive for me  . Its brought from my hard earned money. I feel too much of pain.

The hinge on my laptop envy 360 broke and 3 screws came off from the inside along with little pieces of broken plastic, and now I have a huge gap between the screen and the back cover. I barely moved it and I bought this computer 2 years ago. Since I bought it, I had problems with light bleed and had to return it 3 times!!! I loved HP products in the past but it is extremely frustrating that an expensive equipment is this fragile. I am a very cautious person and since I am a graduate student with a board exam on November, I NEED my computer. Loved the concept of this computer and the benefits of having it be 2 in one but this is terribly executed. HP should fix this for free since a lot of people have the same problem. How can I fix this without wasting much study time?

The hinge on my laptop is broken and the screen is nearly falling out every time I open it. Just contacted HP support and they said it would cost about £230  (about 40% of what i paid for the laptop) which is ridiculous is, or I can have a 7% discount on a new laptop. Why would I want a new HP laptop if the design and customer service is this bad??? There's obviously a design error on this as lots of posts saying the same thing. Did anyone ever get a satisfactory result from HP or are we all just left in limbo?

HP ENVY X360 CONVERTIBLE 15M-ED0023DX screen coming apart and popping out. My laptop sits on a desk and never moves. I am very careful as this laptop is my only laptop for my home business. I shut the laptop and the screen popped out and made a cracking/grinding noise. My laptop is under an extended warranty, and I am advised to mail my laptop to HP. However, I will be without a laptop. I conduct my business on my laptop. I cannot afford to lose business. I requested a laptop loaner. I was denied. I asked if there was an HP service center in my area. There is no service center in my area.I am faced with a decision. Do I keep the laptop as is (defective and faulty design), so I do not sacrifice losing business or do I mail my laptop in for repair and purchase a backup laptop to use while mine is being repaired. I should not have to purchase another laptop, but that would be my only option. I have seen an extensive amount of reviews, pictures, and complaints about the HP X360 convertible’s screen hinge coming apart, yet HP continues to sell this product. In this situation, I believe a loaner laptop would be the right thing to do for the customer. However, the situation is this: I purchased a laptop for $1100. The laptop is defective with a design flaw as evidenced by an extensive amount of customer complaints and reviews (it’s a simple google search), I am advised to mail my laptop in with no guarantee of repair time and no loaner laptop. This is more than an inconvenience; this will have a negative impact on my business. This warranty program is not designed with the customer in mind. If it were, then there would be a reasonable loaner program. People need reliability in the products that they spend hard earned money for. I understand laptops/computers have issues. However, HP has been notified of this HP ENVY X360 CONVERTIBLE 15M-ED0023DX screen coming apart and popping out time and time again, but continue to manufacture and sell this same laptop. It isn’t right. The laptop loaner program isn't right.

Hi, It is unbelievable to find hundred of users having exactly the same problem. I recently have left hinge broken on Spectre XT. Please advise if this issue is well known and supported by your customer support in Thailand. I am going to call them on Monday. My Spectre is out of warranty and I am curious to know how would HP react to such flawed design. Well, I was thinking to buy new Spectre as I thought it was only mine broken. I am scared now as this could happen to the new one too although it seems the new ones have different hinge design. Thanks,Pairoj

Hi,I got buy the x360 for my wife 2 1/2 years ago. Maybe already seem old to some but it has been quite a ride...Initially, the laptop was quite slow and I thought it just needed to be updated. However, it only got worse to the point the laptop cannot be used for even the simplest things. We brought it back to the store while still under warranty and they call back and said it will need to run overnight to install missing updates (I was not able to do the same as it got too slow). However, they were recommended to have a solid-state disk installed as it would help speed it up. I said no, as I bought a product and would expect it to work. I got it back but still too slow to be practically used for even simple tasks. Lockdown came and nobody was listening to complaints. So, I got buy the SSD and more ram and the laptop worked great. That is until keys '9', 'o', 'l', '.', ' stopped working. I tried everything recommended from this and other sites but nothing worked. The only thing I can share is the failure ID: M0C6XA-9B6AMB-GXGJ2K-G4MB03To make matters worse, the screen popped out and after investigating it was the hinge that has broken off. Plenty of those stories around. At this point, I am not willing to spend more money on the laptop so I glued the hinge screw seats back which seem to be somewhat ok but in the process, I managed to crack the screen. Fantastic.Not a great experience, so now I am taking my SSD and ram back and the laptop is going to recycle....

I have an HP Envy with a broken left hinge and when i took it to a auth repair facility they said they couldn't find the parts to fix it - that we needed the hinge and the back cover.  How do i get around unable to find the parts?  It was one of the authorized repair facilities in this area (Grand Rapids, Michigan).  My daughter is borrowing a MacBook to get her through the semester but very stressful.  Unfortunately the 3 repair facilities are all the same franchise so I'm feeling they are a lost cause.   As a retired HP employee, I do try to keep using their products.  Our Notebook is just out of warranty - bought in 11/2021.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated.   Amy

I have had my HP 360 for about 2 years. I see like many other that the hinge on the back of the laptop broke which then inturn made the screen crack. It would seem that many other have had this problem as well. The laptop is no longer under warranty but I clearly see this as a design flaw and would like HP to repair this.

Hi everyone, I wonder if someone could help me? I purchased my HP envy notebook in November 2018 and I haven't had any problems with it until recently. The hinge on the left side is suddenly completely out of sync with the one on the right, so much so that I now can no longer even close the pc or flip it around to use the touch screen.  My warranty ran out in November 2019, so i'm a little over 2 months over. Upon searching for this problem online for a solution or cost to fix I can see that this seems to be a big problem with the Hp Envy PCs.  I have tried to contact HP through their chat but I get redirected to here as my warranty is out of date. I am SO disappointed that this has happened, the PC wasn't cheap and it was an investment that I thought would last me a lot longer than this.  This is my first HP laptop and  it's extremely off-putting. Would HP do anything to help me? Does anyone know the cost of this type of repair?  Thanks in advance - One very upset HP envy owner.

I bought an HP gaming laptop just over a year ago. It started making a cracking noise when opening/closing the lid recently, which is getting worse. I took a look and noticed that the hinge casing has split along the seam. I can click it all back together but on the next screen close/open it'll open right back up again. Knowing that we've looked after it really well and it's not the result of anything other than standard use, I had a look online and noticed that this is a very common problem (i.e. design flaw). Given how common this is, has anyone else managed to get a resolution? Most of the posts on here get answered with a private message so I've no idea on the eventual outcome for any of the other customers. Thanks in advance for any help and advice.

Hello! Bought my hp compaq laptop last year (19/10/2018) and the warranty still valid until next year.I dont exactly remember when the hinge (one side only) broken but it became worse day by day. I find it difficult to close and open the laptop (too tight) and the screen split! Already asked the seller but they said the warranty will not cover for the damage. And i was like — whatttt?! It wasnt even my fault that the hinge broken since there was NOT even ONCE my laptop crashed to the floor or the damage comes from another repair. FYI, it is clearly a manufacturer damage since thousand of users are having the same problem. I bought this laptop without any doubtful thought. i trusted this model than any other models - u name it, Acer, asus, etc. But the quality is so frustrated  I know that once the hinge is broken, the screen will also be affected. Not to mention the internal wires will be exposed once the screen is split open WIDELY! I'm a student, from a poor family, used up all my savings from working part time while studying to buy this laptop (RM3000++ include additional warranty), it's impossible for me to pay for the repair fee or buy another laptop. I need this laptop so much since i'm computer science student. I've already reached out (whatsapp) hp technical support specialist, but i know this case will not be treated the way it should be if i dont take any safe step. Please help me.  Send technician or just give me a new laptop. Eventho i know the latter will be ignored by HP.  Thank you

Hi, the left hand hinge is broken on my laptop resulting in the touchscreen malfunctioning and potential other issues.  It seems this is a known issue with this product and that it is not, in fact, the hinge but rather the base of the outer case screw receivng point camming out over time so that it loses connection and allows the back left portion of the outer casing to bend, dislocate  and become seriously loose.  Given this is an inherent known design flaw can anybody from HP please comment about repairs?  I note also that since knowing about this HP has changed the hinge design.

I care share lots of such posts from your forum, if required, My laptop is still in warranty and any quality issue what so ever must be taken care by your company free of cost. You see a hinge is not that costly part of a laptop, but it is a point of ethics that how you take care of your customers when a quality issue arises.I have use lots of HP products and have never found such poor response from your team. Falsifying the facts and deceiving your clients/customers is not a good practice and you must address it on top priority. I request you to go in depth of this issue and resolve it on priority.

My laptop is just two months out of warranty, and it appears the left hinge has broken.  When I close the laptop, the left hinge cover is separated from the computer.  You can pop it back in place, but as soon as you open the laptop it moves again.  I'm not sure if this is a hinge issue or a hinge cover issue.  How can I fix this?  Thanks.

Have been using the hp 15"" laptop for over a year. All of a sudden noticed that opening the screen is causing a noise and found out that the left hinge is causing the problem. This is causing the screen cover to come off. The warrant has expired recently. Took it to repair shop and the cost to repair is pretty huge. Would like to know from HP, how do we continue to use your products if they are not reliable? How  HP support will help me get the issue fixed?  ThanksAKRUS

I have had this laptop for less than two years and have taken extremely good care of it. I was using it normally when the left side hinge broke. The screws are all still in place, it looks like the plastic they are screwed through/into sheared off so now the hinge moves but when it does the screen is separated from the top of the laptop. I have seen a lot of other similar issues with this with other people on here. Has anyone had any luck with getting it fixed?

I have had this computer for a while -- a year I believe. No drops. Always used and transported with care.

Hi I bought my HP Envy X360 convertible 15-ed1xxx in January 2021 over the course of using it my right hinge staterd poping my screen out of which i took it back at in January 2022 as it was warranty. They replaced the hinge but i am yet faced with disappointment where by I have the same issue again. Highly disppointed due to the fact that such a pricey laptop has such a flaw. With extensive research online this seems to be an reoccuring issue when it comes to the HP Envy. Unfortunately it is out of warranty. What options do I have to get this fixed?

Hi.The right hinge of our HP Envy x360 just randomly broke.This machine was purchased at the end of November 2017, less than 2 years ago.  I am a tech for the small business using this device.  The two screws popped out and the plastic holding in those screws, and now the screen is separated from one hinge.   The device is now unable to support itself or rotate correctly.  The issue actually occurred a couple months ago, but they have been using the device since without other options.   Looking online this issue seems to be widespread for countless users with similar purchase dates and similar breaking points.  Our company works alongside countless business's and schools and this is just wrong for a higher end product, built on the feature of rotation all the way around to break in such a manner.   The business should not have to pay for such a clearly widespread problem.  It also appears the only way to address this issue is by this means of posting on the forums.  My support calls were unable to get to anyone willing to deal with the issue.  We buy and suggest numerous devices to our clients.  I will not be recommending the envy.  I hope I can get some sort of help with this. Thanks, Alex

Hello, just a few days ago I noticed that the display bezel is coming apart from the display leaving a gap. Took it upon myself to open the device and investigate the problem. The issue seems to be that the base on which the hinges are fixed onto the display back cover have become brittle and broke into pieces causing the display to wobble when the notebook is open. The hinge itself is pushing onto the display bezel causing it to separate from the display. I have uploaded pictures of the broken fixing points and the display bezel coming off to Imgur since it wouldn't let me attach them to the post. I would like to know if it's possible to have the back cover and the bezel shipped to Germany since the official spare parts website says that they are out of stock.I believe the numbers for the parts are as goes: Back cover: L20313-001Display bezel: L20309-001Thanks in advance!Link to photos: imgur.com/a/2ZwqChG (Would not let me attach them)

Hello,  I purchased an HP Envy Touchsmart 15 a little over a year ago. The hinge seems to have come unglued fromt the inside. I read that the HP Envy is prone to this, since the hinge is glued in production as opposed to being fastened with a screw. I'm a graduate student, and I'm unable to use my HP for schoolwork due to the faulty hinge. The computer has been handled carefully, and it's never been dropped. This is my first HP. It was great when it was working; however, a laptop that costs nearly a grand and works only for 1 year due to the construction is extremelhy dissapointing.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem and how it was handled by HP. I purchased it through costco, so I should have an extended 2 year warranty on the device.  Thanks in advance,  Alexandria

The right hinge of my HP Envy x360 laptop has broken off internally. Searching the forum, it appears this is a design flaw in the hinge for the Envy x360 series. I've found several posts with the same problem.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x....https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Quality-issues-with-Envy-x360-....https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Breaking-hinge-on-HP-EN....https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x.... However, a few of the above posts imply that HP may be doing something about remediation for those affected by this apparent design flaw.I believe my laptop is out of warranty, which means I have no recourse other than to pay out of pocket for the repair, and I do not want to pay for an obvious design flaw on the laptop. I've been cautious with my laptop, and I do not force the lid close or anything that would cause this damage. Up until this hinge broke, I was very happy with the laptop. I even recommended it as a purchase to several people. I've since rescinded that recommendation because of this design flaw.

My case has broken at the left hinge.  It was fixed by HP under warranty, but the fix didn't last, so I decided to fix it myself.  Lots of broken plastic in the area, but got it cleaned up and JB welded all the breaks and added reinforcements.  Seems to be good as I temporarilly attachd the display and it open and closes as it should and the case is holding together.Now the problem:  There are 2 black wires from the display that connect to the motherboard.  They are numbered 1, and 2, and to make sure I got them back where they belong  I marked one with a red sharpie ( I didnt see the numbers on them until after they were disconnected ).  For some reason, ( distractions ) I must have neglected to mark the connector that the red marked lead goes to.  Can someone here tell me which lead goes where?  I don't want to have gone to all this work and wind up blowing something up.  Also, please tell me how the connectors work.  I can't seem to figure out how to put them together.

I purchased an HP Laptop for my daughter in March of this year. The hinges are falling apart. She barely got through finals. The hinges are so damaged at this point she does not want to open it for fear of doing more damage. It is hard for me to believe that HP is not a reliable computer anymore. I have always purchased HP products for their reliability; I was hoping to pass that on to my daughter. I was informed when I called tech support that they would send me a box and it would cost me 350.00 to have it repaired. I was always under the belief that HP stands behind their products. My question now is, why am I paying for repairs when the product is not even one year old?  I can no longer tell anyone HP is the better product and they stand behind their product.

Hi support,My screen is shot due to the poor hinges on the screen. The bezel has now popped off in the bottom right corner where the screws that hold the screen to the hinge just came off, there were bits of plastic falling out of there too. can you help? I cant believe I paid so much for a laptop that is literally falling apart. I am out of warranty,  but hoping theres something you can do about it.

The hinge on my laptop (out of warranty) is messed up. The laptop still works perfectly fine and I can use it, however the hinge prevents me from closing it or even adjusting the screen even slightly. It is really loose, and I can feel that the hinge has come apart at the back. Every time I try to adjust the screen it makes a cracking noise and becomes looser. I have found a small bit of black plastic (like, a tiny bit) which I assume has come off of it but it might not be from the laptop. It is also pulling apart the casing around the screen of the laptop. I understand that it is likely not going to be possible to fix this without paying, but is there anything I can do to fix it even slightly? It is very inconvenient as I can't bring my laptop anywhere and I have to be incredibly careful whenever moving it. Thank you in advance.

Hello,  I have an HP ENVY TouchSmart 17 j141nr Signature Edition Laptop, and the hinge mounting points have completely broken apart into plastic crumbs. The crumbs literally hit the cpu fan and jammed the blades from spinning, rendering my computer temporarily useless. As I have learned from this community, this appears to be a common problem with this particular laptop design, if not others as well. I am posting this to seek support from an HP representative who would be able to contact me directly about immediate repair options-that is what others have done in the past. Upon your contact, I should have all the necessary information you require about my laptop. Best regards,Envy Laptop Owner

I have the same issue as a multitude of other posts here.The right-hand side hinge of my X360 has broken and I am unable to move the screen or close it. I called HP support about this issue over a week ago and was sent an email and asked to respond with proof of purchase and a couple of pictures, which I did.It has been over a week and a follow-up email since then. I called again this week and was told I would get a call back from the person handling my case, but no one called me back.So I sent an email to the support email. It is now the 4th day with no response.

   Hello. I bought My HP pavilion Notebook in 2016, and i have recently been having problems with the left hinge being loose and broken. Whenever i try to open my computer, the left side of the bottom “board” (where the keyboard is) opens up, which makes it very hard to open or close the computer!

Hallo,ich habe am 18.08.17 mein NOtebook NTB HP Envy 15x360 15-bp007ng FHDi5 nagelneu gekauft. Das Notebook ist um 360 Gradklappbar mit tablet Funktion. Nach 2 Jahren und 6 Wochen habe ichfestgestellt, dass sich der Deckel des Bildschirms vom Bildschirmlöst, da dort das Plastik gebrochen ist an der rechten unteren Ecke,wo das Scharnier ist. Das bedeutet, dass eine Lücke zwischenBildschirm und Deckel sich auftut und der Laptop nur zugeklappt werdenkann mit dem Risiko, dass die Kabel und Halterung herauskommen.Das Notebook wurde in den 2 Jahren insgesamt ca. 30x geklappt. Nichtöfter, da es nicht transportiert wurde und die Funktion als Tabletsehr selten genutzt wurde. Das Notebook wird generell nur für denPrivatgebrauch am Wochenende für max. 4h genutzt und steht an einemfesten Platz.Wie kann es sein, dass das Material anscheinend so minderwertig ist bzw. die Verarbeitung, dass es selbst dieser geringen Belastung nicht standhält?Können Sie mir bitte mögliche Optionen nennen, was man tun kann nach Ablauf der Garantie? Und zu den anderen Kommentaren, die die extrem schwachen Scharniere bemängeln:Ja, das war von Anfang an der Fall, dass diese extrem schwach waren und sich der Bildschirm bei der kleinsten Berührung selbstständig weiter nach hinten geklappt hat bzw. wenn ein bestimmter Winkel überschritten wurde, er ganz nach unten klappte - und das bei einem nagelneuen Model für über 1000€.Vielen Dank für eine Rückmeldung!

Hello,Similar to many others on this forum, the hinge on my HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touchscreen Laptop broke as I opened my laptop. This has happened just 6 days after the 1 year warranty expired! The laptop was never dropped or misused. It was hardly even moved off the desk where it has been used for just a few days over a year.HP needs to address this situation as this is clearly a manufacturing defect as can be seen from the multiple posts on this forum. I am obviously very unhappy with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem. A computer in this price range should not break barely over one year of normal usage. $1000 for a laptop that only stays intact a year is unacceptable! I have a 11 year old Lenovo and 8 year old Macbook in perfect physical condition. HP needs to fix this for its users free of cost. Others with similar problem -https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-on-HP-Envy-x360/t...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p... Pictures of my laptop

I'm doing a repair for a friend. The screen is busted from the bottom right hand side and spider webbed out. It's a pretty good shatter. And the bottom right corner of the display is popped out. (Made it easy to remove the broken display) I reinstalled the new lcd display and went to click it in to place and noticed 2 screws are missing from the right hand hinge. Tried to tighten the one screw that was left and it was even touching anything... So I unscrewed one from the left side and saw the bushings that are inserted into the holes of the hinge...gently tried to remove it to maybe rig it so each side had some support.... But no luck... Then I spent 20 minutes searching the web for these bushing replacement and I can't find anything that will work.... How do I fix this part of the laptop which is a load bearing piece due to the screen swiveling as far as it does.......???? When I say bushing, I mean the little plastic and metal pieces that fit inside the hole to make it possible for the tiny screw to screw in.... I thought new hinges should come with them already inside.. nope....just open holes... Help????

Based on research this appears to be a known issue/problem with the design of the HP notebooks. I have an HP Pavillion Notebook that I purchased in 2016 so it is out of warranty. It has not been dropped at any time but the left side of the base is lifting and cracked which is affecting the power function and display. I really do not think it is right to have to pay for repair of something that is a known defect in the product. Does anyone have connection to support that can help with this? Thank you for your assistance.

Hello,I bought an HP 17-byo0136nf lap top less than a month ago.  When opening my computer last night I heard a cracking sound and slowly continued opening it.   The plastic hinge cover between the keyboard and the screen popped off. After about an hour I successfully was able to put the piece back.  However I believe it is defective, because there is a very slight gap on the left side where I can see the silver wire. My history is that I live in France and bought the computer through the HP store there.Further, I need to use this computer for another three weeks as I am a teacher  and I use it.  So I care not to send it into the repair services. I would just prefer that HP sent me a new part.  Is this possible?  (Otherwise the computer works, believe me I am careful when I open it and close it.) Is there a French HP contact number in France and are there any English speaking customer service reps?  I speak French fluently, however not in computer speakease.   I would appreciate any feedback. Cheers Amyhb

Hi, I purchased my HP Pavillion laptop in October 2018. I done use it a huge amount (i.e. not for work) and i'm really disappointed. The problem is that the bottom right hinge seems to have snapped, leaving me barely able to open it for fear of making the problem worse.  When i do try to open it, the black part of the screen begins to peel/ pop off and i am really concerned. I would understand if we were 5+ years down the line and it could be wear and tear but this is relatively new.Needless to say, I haven't dropped the laptop and this isn't the quality that I was promised. I am now left with a laptop that im too scared to use/open.

I bought HP over Acer, Lenovo and Asus because i believed that the one thing that HP offers each time, is exquisite build quality. However, today I was met with a nasty surprise. The left hinge (one near the power button) has seemingly come undone, as if on its own.  Surprised as I was, I contacted technical support. Surprise Surprise, my warranty information is wrong. Ive lost out on half an years warranty services.  FLASH BACK: DUBAI - Notebook bought on the 3rd of Feb, 13 - High hopes.SKIP TO PRESENT: INDIA - Broken hinge and warranty lost. So I took a deep breath, and opened up the trusty HPSA again, informing the specialist about my ""mistaken date of purchase"" (note, I am in India at the time). I am informed by the technician that i have to ""contact the HP tech assistance in UAE to rectify the issue."" STRIKE ONE. So, everyone knows how ""good"" the waranty services in India are. I remember having an old all in one HP printer. The printer malfunctioned, so we took it to the closest ""Authorised"" HP service centre. The first day we went, we werent given any ""service"". The next day we went, they claimed NOTHING under the warranty covers it. They could be right, but oh well, we paid for rectification. So now I'm feeling like its going to be a repeat of the last time. And its funny, since I have found A LOT of people with the same problem. I dont want to rubbish the customer support, BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN THEM HELP OTHER PEOPLE. The sad part is that these people are mostly from the States.  Maybe its not justified, but it always seems like the developing countries get the worst of both worlds. We are the highest consuming population, yet we get the inflated prices (which I know are due to a lot of factors outside the control of the company) and poor service.  I cant believe that there is not a single HP service centre in Mumbai is, well, purely HP, and not a 3rd party ""authorised dealer"". I guess cant do anything about it and maybe I write this in vain, but if someone is listening (or reading), can I suggest atleast have ONE non third party service centre. It'll help a GREAT deal. I hope someone can help me. Ak

My HP Envy laptop is less than two years old and recently, moving the screen from tablet mode the left hinge broke. I invested my money in this laptop because I trusted HP and their laptops, but now looking into it I see that numerous people have had the same issue with the faulty hinge. My laptop being over a year old is out of warranty, but seeing the same issue pop up again and again for this particular laptop, I can't help but think that HP is in some way responsible for selling a faulty product. Can HP repair my laptop or help in anyway? At the very least I sincerely suggest you consider recalling this model of the HP Envy and revise the construction of the hinges. I did not mistreat my laptop and having spent so much on it, being in this situation is devastating. I hope for the sake of HP and its customers, they consider this issue.

Hello!I am wondering if there is anything I can do about the broken hinges on my laptop. The laptop is out of warranty, however everything is working fine on it aside from the broken hinges, which have caused the plastic holding up the display screen to crack over time because the screen is not properly supported. The broken hinges occurred with normal use, not from carelessness. On the phone with customer support, they acknowledged that this was a manufacturing issue, but that I was not able to get it repaired because too much time had passed since I purchased the laptop. I have seen other customers talk about the HP design issues that have caused the hinges on their laptops to break.Is there anything I can do? I don't understand how I'm responsible for HP's design issue. I do not have money for a new laptop or a repair. Even though the laptop is older, it would still be in perfect, usable condition if not for the design issue that led to the hinges breaking when they shouldn't have. I would understand if there was other damage that was my own fault, but the hinge design issue is well-documented and customer support representatives also acknowledged that it was a manufacturing issue.Thank you for your help!

 I have an HP Pavilion x360 14-cd1023tx. Currently my laptop is in the service center because the right side hinges push the screen out, causing the screen to crack. For the record, my laptop has never been dropped and rarely used in tablet mode. What I want to ask, is the damage included in the warranty? Because I was informed that the warranty does not apply to cracked screens, only to hinges. I also was asked to pay for a replace of a broken screen, eventhough the screen is cracked due to hinges.

Hi! So my HP laptop has quite a strange problem that I haven't seen anywhere on the web. Recently I'm unable to connect to my wifi network at home, even if I'm standing next to the router I only get a very weak connection.

It seems like other notebook owners are having a similar problem.

Recently, while opening-up my HP-ENVY-360 laptop, I heard a cracking noise and noticed damage to one of the hinges that connects the monitor to the keyboard. A small screw and tiny pieces of plastic were scattered about on my desk as well. I researched this issue online and found out that damage to the hinges has been a very common problem with HP Laptops. What is the best option I have for getting this repaired? Unfortunately, my one-year warranty expired in November of 2021. Given that this has been a common issue with these laptops, in addition to the fact that I did nothing out of the ordinary with my laptop, I do not feel that I should have to pay for these repairs. Any guidance would be much appreciated.  Thank you!

My HP  laptop right hinge broke and the left corner is cracked and bulging. The laptop was not dropped or fell. When I move the lid the hinge is shifting and then seperating lower case from the upper case. I am now basically unable to move the lid at all, or close it over, from fear it's going to snap right off.  From a 5 minute search it seems like a very common problem, and long-term problem.

I bought my 15-bs192od laptop last year on November 22nd and today, 1 week after the warranty expired, the left hinge broke.  I've seen many complaints about the left hinge on various HP laptops.  Are these really that weak?  I think it is unacceptable for something to have such a high failure rate- especially just outside of warranty.  I don't travel with my laptop, it has never been dropped.  Just opened approximately every day.  This is clearly a defect in quality.  Is this something I can fix myself?  Does HP ever offer goodwill warranty for problems like this just outside of the expiration?

This question may well have been asked before and I apologies if it's going over old ground but the hinge assembly on my hp envy 13 aq002na, by which I mean the plastic that houses the nuts that the hinges in place, have broken making it very hard to open and close the laptop lid without pulling itself apart.

Hi,I have an HP Pavilion Gaming 15 cx-0xxx. Suddenly, one day I noticed the hinge started making a cracking noise. After a few days, the plastic started to come off from the screen. See the image below:-The condition of the screen is worsening day by day and the hinge also makes noise when i try to close the laptop. The hinge is also inclined towards the left side. See the image below:I am very disappointed by the quality of material used by HP. It is not accidental damage. The laptop was handled carefully but the HP support guys told that it is not covered in warranty. Can it be fixed? If yes then what will be the approximate cost?Please tell me. I want it to get fixed ASAP. It is getting worse day by day.

My HP Pavilion au-628tx laptop left hinge broke and the left corner is cracked and bulging. The laptop was not dropped or fell. This is essentially a design flaw from HP, also mentioned in previous issue: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Left-Hinge-Broken-Corner-of-La... . My laptop's extended warranty period recentl ended and this crack developed before it. Earlier, a small crack developed and the screw fell for which I complained but received no response from HP. But now, the issue is unbearable. The laptop costed me a good amount and this is entirely the fault of design as I have used it with due care. I was not aware about this issue before and how it becomes such a problem later.  I not at all expected such a poor quality product from HP shelling huge amount of money. Please help. Thank you in advance.

I'm writing in this thread because I've seemed to have noticed an issue that has come up with my relatively new laptop. I purchased my HP ENVY x360 - 15m-cp0011dx brand new from Best Buy in early to mid-June of last year (2019) and already, the hinge is having issues. Now I've noticed quite sometime earlier that the right hinge on my laptop was a little off and crooked, but nothing seemed wrong with the screen position or opening and closing the lid. But recently, I've realized that now the right hinge is making a small crack or popping noise when open and close the lid. And I've also noticed that when my laptop is shut, the broken hinge is literally causing the laptop screen to be misaligned with the bottom portion of the laptop. I""m very upset because I've managed to upgrade the system's ram and have a lot of personal things and progress stored on this laptop, and now I may have to return it. This really shouldn't be happening to a brand new, quite high-quality laptop that costs around $800. I've taken good care of this laptop and have not dropped it or bumped it into anything, or done anything to cause harm like this to the computer. And obviously, with COVID-19 going around, all Best Buy stores are closed so I can't do anything right now. So my questions are these; Best Buy said I only had a 14-Day window to return this laptop in case anything were to happen to it, which is obviously long gone by now. Will the manufacturer warranty cover this damage? It was not caused by me and obviously came from use, but it shouldn't happen this early to a brand new laptop. Best buy said the manufacturer warranty only covers internal hardware damage that was not caused by the user but rather manufacturer error. And speaking of which, I just checked my laptop's manufacturer warranty status, which is supposed to last for a year. My warranty status ""Warranty Removed from Product"" because this laptop was apparently ""Designated to be returned to HP. Thus, the warranty has been removed from product"", and I had no idea about this and was not notified. I'm very upset and infuriated with this issue right now because this HP laptop hasn't been a reliable product, especially for its price, and the warranty seems to be obsolete and no longer reliable as well. How can I rely on the services that HP has to offer and another laptop if I were to purchase from HP again when I can't even rely on a brand new laptop that only lasted for about 6 months? Image of Warranty Status:

Hi, I have (amongst others) an HP Office jet 6210 printer given to me 12 years ago by my daughters. It has performed magnificent service over the past 12 years, but alas, as seems to be the case with many other owners, both ADF hinges have broken (the hinges supporting the main body you lift when replacing cartridges). I have purchased replacement hinges as I am loathe to throw away a present from my daughters but the left hinge sits lower than the right when screwed in with the Hex 12 screws. This means the left side of the lid now ""sits"" on the printer body (it was always lower than the right side (and most people in the community appear to comment that the left hinge breaks first). I have checked the broken old hinges with the new ones and they are identical. So, can anyone please help me to keep this prized and trusted jewel working?Thank you in anticipation.

he left hinge has become detached/broken on the monitor side (HP Pavilion - 14-ce2500sa) This in turn cause the bottom monitor frame to pop out.  Over past few weeks it got significantly worse as I am unable to close the laptop to prevent from any further damage. The screen works perfectly fine and there are no cracks there.Originally it came as a surprise because the laptop was kept in a good condition, no drops or bumps with very minimal use. However, after doing some research, it seems that this issue is rather common issue, suggesting that this is a manufacturing defect.  Could you please inform me if there was any system in place to resolve and if so, what further actions can be taken? Many thanks!

My laptop that I bought 1n August 2019, started breaking apart due to just everyday normal use upon opening and closing, The hinge is broken and tearing the whole frame apart. I cannot even close it now. From what I see, this has been an ongoing issue in many of the HP laptops. I expected more. Spent a good deal more on this one, thinking it would last longer. I have never dropped or done anything to it physically. I take very good care of it. I feel HP should stand behind their product, and fix or replace this for me. One year of owning and using just on a daily average basis, with no harm to it, it is just unacceptable. I know the one year warranty ran out  as soon as I realized the problem was just going to get worse. But do they not have pride in their product, or own up to their defects in quality? I need some answers. I can't even get a number of email to actually speak with a live agent. The virtual assistant is absolutely no use in this situation. Has any one else had problems with these hinges. It seems to be more than just this model on the reviews that I have been researching. PLEASE, help me out if you have any info that could help. Thank you for your time

 The left hinge on my laptop suddenly started to break.  I don't move the laptop around all that much and  the hinge failed anyway.  From looking at other messages I've seen that this is a common problem for this laptop model. I wonder if HP has done a recall for this product.  If it hasn't it really ought to take some responsibility because it is plainly a manufacturing defect, apparently caused by a decision to use plastic instead of metal for the hinges.

Hi.  The right hinge of my laptop has broken, all of a sudden it has gotten very stiff and and the exterior border now detaches from my screen completely. I now cannot close my laptop at all without cracking and the screen coming apart on the right side. The hinge cover has come off at the back and I don't know what to do! I can't even move the screen without it making a popping noise and when carrying it, I have to do so very carefully in case it falls apart. I've only had this laptop for 2 and a half to 3 years. It has also never fallen or been stepped on/any other accidents.

Please help! After saving up my money for over a year, I was finally able to afford (with some help from a promotion being run on Costco) for a HP Envy 360 Laptop in June 2019. I bought the warranty (1 year manufacturer's + 1 year Costco) and this past Friday (4/30/2021) I went to go open my laptop and the hinge was broken/misaligned. There is a substantial gap between the screen and the keypad and I am worried that if I do not fix the laptop, the hinge will snap and my entire laptop will stop working. Similar to other posts I have read, this doesn't sound like a ""normal wear and tear"" situation, but, rather a manufacturing defect. After saving up for over a year I have been very careful with this laptop and it is disappointing that this malfunction has happened and there is no one I can get into contact to help me resolve the issue. From a quick search with this laptop and hinge in the subject, over 2000 posts came back, this doesn't seem like an isolated incidence.  Picture of my Laptop: Back: The left hinge is misaligned from the rest of the laptop (right side on this picture) Front of the Laptop (Notice how the left hinge is not aligned) -- It is sticking straight up versus being on a tilt like the other hinge  Closer View of the Hinge (From the Front) After googling and trying to get in contact with Costco (this item does not fall under their warranty) and HP (the product is past the warranty) I have been unable to get in contact with anyone at HP to help me with the problem.  Realistically speaking, with the amount of money I paid for this laptop, I was planning on using this laptop for as long as possible. Barely 2 years in and the hinge is broken and I can't even get any live support to help me with the problem.

I purchased an Envy x360, the first Ryzen laptop, three years ago.  It was a wonderful laptop, until the bottom-left corner of the screen started separating from the clamshell.  I let it go because I thought that it was a minor problem when it was only a tiny separation, and I didn't want to make a silly warranty claim.  The more the screen was lifted and closed, the worse the separation became, until, when the screen was lifted on Thanksgiving Day, the screen broke away from the clamshell.  Can this laptop be fixed?

Hello, My HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook hinge is broken and I'm not able to close it properly. I used this laptop only for my professional use and I see this as a common issue occurring in these models.  This is definitely a design flaw and I would like to get my laptop fixed.  Thanks!

When we closed the computer the hinge slipped slightly out of place and cracked the the screen popped the screen slightly out of the case. I called HP, they called their design flaw an “accident” and offered to repair it for $406 (I paid $499 for it). The representative literally laughed at me for not buying accident insurance. I am sorry, but I didn’t realize the computer was such a POS and that it was necessary. HP was rude, not helpful, and seems to take no responsibility for the quality of the products they sell.Please fix this. I thought I could rely more on your products.

I've seen a few threads and realized that a lot of people are having the same issue that I'm having with my HP Envy. Basically after my warranty expired the hinge on my laptop broke free from the display enclosure and cracked my display. To continue to be able to use the laptop I had to disable the touch screen driver. After using it for some time with the one broken hinge (trying to be as careful as possible) the second hinge broke as well. Now its impossible to keep the laptop open without support from a wall or something that I can rest the screen against. I'm curious to what my options are because it appears that anyone who owns this style laptop will encounter this problem at one point or another due to poor design, assembly and quality of parts. I've owned many HP laptops and never experienced anything like this and hope that. I paid a decent amount of money for this laptop with some expectation of longevity so please help me out.

I want to ask that will a standard HP Warranty cover this damage? It wasn't an accidental Damage or intentionally done.   Notebook Specification i5 10th Gen 1035G18 GB Ram DDR4512 GB SSD (skhynix)Intel UHD G1Ded GPU - NVIDIA MX 130 (2GB VRAM)

I bought the laptop about 1 year ago. The screen hinges was stiff, now it has broken the plastic top and the chassis is separating at the spine. Never been dropped, always opened from center, handled gently. Terrible, disgusting, awful machine, made from crap components with zero design or testing. Can anyone from HP describe how such an abysmal, piece of junk ever passed your non-0existent quality control. Crap company, crap computer. Now  I have that stated, can someone describe how to get it fixed. Please.

My HP envy-360 laptop, which is past its expiration date, has started to have problem with its left side hinge. When I try to close it, it makes a cracking noise as if the screen is about to break apart from the side. I have seen and heard about many people having the same problem. I took it to a technician today, who refused to fix it saying it could damage the motherboard if he tried to fix it. I can’t travel any where with the laptop. Help and advice would be much appreciated!

Hello, my Envy360 is about 2 years old and sits on a desk all day. It never travels and has never been dropped or otherwise abused. This also happened to me out of the blue. I went to open it and the hinge broke away from inside the lid and the screen broke. I should not have to pay for this to be fixed since is an obvious defect/known issue occurring to multiple users on multiple posts from around the world.

Hi, I bought my HP Envy 360 at the end of 2017. Similarly to lots of other people on this forum I have taken good care of the laptop however last week I opened it as usual and the left hinge broke causing a crack in my screen which is gradually getting worse. I can no longer close my laptop as doing so causes further damage.  As this is a common issue I'd appreciate a response from HP on how to proceed without needing to use the paid telephone technical support.  Thank you.

Hello,I stopped using my computer about a year ago due to the right hinge breaking off of the the frame.  Every time I opened it the gap got wider and wider, it made a terrible cracking sound, and then screws started falling out.  The computer came from COSTCO but is no longer under warranty as I waited too long to research fixes on this problem.  I see now that others have had this problem but not sure if HP is still providing free fix for out of warranty laptops.  We were loyal HP customers as this computer was purchased in 2019 to replace a 2012 HP computer.  I am now back to using that old, heavy, and outdated 2012 computer because I cant open the newer computer without increasing the damage.  I have looked at YouTube 'fixes' but the receptacles for the screws are no longer attached to the body of the computer.  Can anyone help with a suggestion.  Thank you!!

Bought this laptop just short of a year ago for my wife.  Recently discovered the case is broken at the hinges, and the camera has stopped working (no longer listed in device manager). Researched the broken case/hinges and have found it is a common problem with these HP laptops, apparently has been for a lengthy period of time, and that HP doesn't care as they have not responded by altering/strengthening the hinge attachment points on their laptops.  Chalk that up to being a huge corporation, and planned obsolescence is profitable!  Nonetheless, there are a plethora of videos/forum posts about HP laptop broken cases - all the same: the brass inserts have broken out of the thin plastic supports.  With this in mind, I'm wondering if others who've run into the same problems have had problems getting HP to warranty/replace the cases?  How much of a fight am I likely to have on my hands getting HP to fix the case? The other problem is the camera malfunction.  It was showing and disappearing from device manager, alternatively functioning and not functioning.  Finally, it rarely if every is displayed under device manager and is never functional.  Have searched for and reinstalled the latest device driver, and recently reinstalled the OS (win 10); but to no avail.  Haven't been able to find much of anything regarding this camera malfunction.  Any ideas why this is happening?  Broken wiring?  Faulty camera hardware?  Driver/software problem? Thanks for your assistance!

Hi! I have the hp envy laptop. I use my laptop meticulously. The left hinge just popped open and now the screen at the bottom left is opening. This laptop was not misused or mishandled in any way. As I put my issue into the hp community search bar countless threads popped up of customers who have had the same issue. This issue seems to have already happened on envy laptops snce 2014! My laptop is just 2 years old. I assume my warranty is expired. This really calls into question HP's brand and the quality of their products.   This is clearly a design flaw, a defect,  When I contacted HP they say I should just take it to a local repair place with a price quote of $150 to $300. HP, as a reputable company, should please stand behind their product and take responsibility for a design flaw in an otherwise great laptop! Hope to hear from you soon!Thank you!

Hi there.I noticed last night that the display on my x360 separates from the frame when I put the display into tablet mode. Specifically it's the bottom right corner of the screen, by the hinge. It looks like something may be broken close to the hinge. I'm surprised as the laptop has been well looked after, not been dropped and there are no signs of any damage in that area of the laptop. I can't see a way on-line to raise a case with HP about this. Despite the laptop being in warranty, the HP support website indicates this is the place to raise my issue. Any help/advice would be appreciated... Many Thanks!

I opened my laptop up to begin my Monday at work, and the right hinge gave out with an awful *CRRRIIICCCK* noise. Now my screen is separated from the lid any time I attempt to open it. Thankfully it did not shatter or compromise the LCD panel when this occurred.Having always taken care of this device (since it is critical for my job as a support specialist while on call,) I am disappointed that the hinge has failed seemingly out of nowhere. I am concerned that if I open the device too often it will tear the screen permanently away from the lid or otherwise destroy it. This seems like a design flaw as I have seen many other similar threads in my research with no good resolution. Naturally, my warranty period expired just a few weeks ago...  While I have a lot of experience repairing electronics, the repair process involves removing the entire LCD panel from the lid and removing easy release tape which I do not have on hand to put it back together. There is also the sinking feeling that this could happen on the other hinge at any time and render the device even more useless. Please advise on my options.

In the beginning of October 2020 I contacted HP via Whatsapp because the screen cover on the bottom left of the screen came off. Now, several months later, it is worse and yesterday evening the hinge broke when I closed my laptop!! I want to get this fixed, because I read that many others have this problem too and it's ridicuous to think that a €1000,- gaming laptop breaks that fast!!! See pictures below to see how badly it's broken.oktober 2020june 2021

I have the same issues as many HP owners, it seems.  Poor initial construction and plastic parts have led to breaking hinges on BOTH sides of the laptop.  I use this only at home, no traveling, carefully cared for.  I get crackling and snapping every time I open it, I now need to leave it open to prevent the top from completely breaking or breaking the laptop casing.  That being said, the actual operation is fine.   Is there any recourse with HP to fix this issue as it appears to be a very common issue?  It began deteriorating recently.  Thanks for any help.

7 months old HP ENVY X360.... I noticed the left side of my screen casing splitting when I would try to open and close my laptop. This thing is supposed to go all the way around to use as a tablet. I have never even used it that way. Just opened and closed it. Never dropped, Never even took it out of the house. I am a senior so I am gentle with things. Upon closer examination it appears that the left hinge is loose and not quite aligned right. HP said send it back and they would rush the fix. They sent a box and paperwork that does not reflect what I was told. Nothing about the actual problem I was having or the rush and the free pick up I was supposed to get was not included. I was uncomfortable sending it back so I researched online and found that I am not alone with this hinge issue, and some people had been waiting weeks to get theirs back. The hinge issue is a common one because it runs so hot that it melts some flimsy plastic part that eventually melts and causes the hinge to fail. Of people that sent it back under warranty most were accused of dropping it and told it would cost them to fix it. Of the ones who paid for the fix it only lasted 3 months or so. I have had issues with this from the beginning with it freezing up after every update. I have spend countless times with HP assistant fixing it after an update and finally tried to turn off all updates.  It runs hot and frankly I feel I wasted $600 on this thing and need to go buy something decent  If they want to send me a brand new one I will try again, and then wipe this and send it back. I do not want to fix this. It's a bad design and will just happen again. To me this should be a recall.  Is there a way I can get a credit toward upgrading it to a better design? Something more sturdy that is not going to break? And one that will not crash every time windows updates.  Photo of the issue below

The hinge on my laptop has broken at some point when just opening and closing my laptop. The broken hinge is making the screen bulge out considerably and I'm scared that the next time I open it, the screen is going to shatter. I've taken great care of this thing and looking on the forums it seems as if this is a common defect with the model. I spent a good bit of money on what I thought was going to be a laptop that was quality made to last me through medical school. It's been maybe 2 years since I've had the thing and it's frustrating to see that this is a known issue. Now I'm in the middle of the semester so I cannot go a day without a computer for study purposes and a live HP support seems unreachable. I'm just posting on this forum to see if HP will send me a direct message because I've gone through everything automated and have gotten nothing accomplished.

I have had my HP ENVY X360 for about 4 months (bought new). Yesterday when I went to close the screen I heard a cracking popping noise. I opened the laptop back up to find the left hinge broken and a crack in the screen from the hinge attachment area. I contacted support today (10/21/2021) and they told me that if it was just the hinge it would be covered under warranty, but because the screen cracked, it is not. The screen cracked because of the broken hinge. The only way to prevent this issue would have been if I had known the hinge was faulty and never have opened or closed my laptop.

The bottom right corner of my computer screen popped open the other day.  Today I tried to open it and the (now apparently broken) hinge crushed through the front glass. Two small screws or rivets fell out and it cannot be open or shut without doing further damage.  Other than that it works great.  Given that I bought it in late 2017, it is out of warranty, but I wanted to post here to see if the admin or community had any advice or suggestions.  It's a great laptop.  I'm really bummed it's broken like this.  I would love to get it fixed with minimal cost. Is this some kind of recall maybe?  ThanksBen

Hi, First off, I would like to apologise for starting a new thread. I've seen quite a few issues around this topic on this forum so could have jumped onto one of them but thought my message could easily get lost/be ignored in doing so. The left hinge on my laptop failed over Christmas and resulted in the bottom left of the screen jutting out: Luckily, the screen and touchscreen are still fine. I got in contact with HP on the 29th of December. I decided to ring them back today as I hadn't heard anything from them. I kind of wish I hadn't as they've quoted me £314.29 () for its repair. They also claimed that it wasn't a manufacturing defect.  To give you some background info: it's in warranty, but as I brought it second-hand, HP tells me that that voids the warranty. I have tried getting in contact with the person I brought it off but had no response.  I guess I've come on here to get people's opinions really. I'm obviously frustrated at what I would consider a relatively new/modern laptop breaking so soon. What has really annoyed me, however, is the cost of repair on top of that. From reading other people's threads on the issue/watching YouTube vids, it seems to be the piece of plastic holding the screws that will have broken. So feel like I'm basically being asked to pay £314.29 to replace a small piece of plastic .  So - should I just shut up, stop moaning and pay the £314.29? (I wish I could afford to). Or, has anyone had any luck getting a repair much cheaper than what I'm being quoted by going down another avenue I'm not sure of?Thanks for your time. Ben

Hi pals, I'm just after some advice really. I've had this laptop a while now - about two years. Within a couple of months of owning it, one of the hinges broke. Then after a while, the second one started to go as well. I really should of got it fixed earlier, but I haven't got round to it. The laptop still runs OK, but I've obviously a bit worried about it going kaput in the near future unless I manage to sort out the hinge issue. My questions are really as follows:Does every single HP laptop have different hinges? I'm looking on ebay at the minute for some used replacements and there's so many different options. I would of thought all HP Envy 17 laptops would have the same hinges...am I wrong to assume this? I'll give you an example: there's this one: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/HP-Envy-17-1000-Series-17-1050ea-RIGHT-Screen-Bracket-Hinge-FBSP8028010/18... - then there's this one: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/HP-Envy-17-J-17-J141NA-LCD-Screen-Support-Hinge-Bracket-6055B0025601-LEFT...I'm basically not sure which hinges I should be buying.Secondly, looking at the pictures, is there anything else I might need replacing? I need a new battery as well, so I'm just trying to work out whether it's worth getting everything fixed on this laptop or just waiting for it to die and get a new one.Thanks for any help/advice you can give.My laptop produce number is F7T68EA#ABU if that's any help.Ben

My friend, who is a retired septuagenarian, has a machine which is reported in system information to be an HP Laptop 15-bs0xx.  She really likes this machine and has had it less that two years. Unfortunately, recently, when being placed on an upholstered footstool, it apparently caught the bottom right edge of the top on some fabric and a small amount of torque was applied to it, causing the hinge to break (with just a small amount of force).  The inconvenience of a broken hinge is one thing (the laptop cannot be closed and the screen sags somewhat), but worse is that this damage seems to have affected the electronics.   Sometimes the image on the screen fads or disappears in parts, and other times information from the computer to the screen is not updated.  Worst of all, the computer is now subject to frequent crashes (random except for the fact that they are far more frequent when it is being moved from place to place) that were never experienced until this mishap. I gather HP has had problems with hinges breaking and has mostly been unable to response satisfactorily to these problems.  However, I think my friend can live with the broken hinge, provided that the issues with the electronics themselves can be addressed. The machine is less than two years old!   And this was reportedly a very small amount of force placed upon it.   Does anyone have any advice on what can be done?  I have open up an HP chromebook before to reseat a wifi card, with positive results, so I do not mind trying to open this one up and hopefully might find that there is just some cable which has become somewhat detached, or something like that.   Otherwise, attempting to get it serviced is probably not worth the cost...

I have the same problem! I was always careful to never drop my laptop and the hinge broke on its own and cracked my screen. It seems to be an HP design flaw since a lot of people seem to be having this issue. It's been a little over a year since I bought this laptop and am very disappointed. Since I'm a college student I need to get this fixed ASAP. Please help!

My right hinge is broken and does not allow my laptop to open and close properly. I’ve been trying to just deal with it for a while, but it’s gotten so annoying I just need it fixed. Is there a way to fix it myself or do I have to get it done professionally?

Hello HP Community, I've previously been a lurker but- literally one week after my warranty expired- I came inside from the park after playing with my toddler to see the left hinge of my screen broken & the screen itself popped out!! There are currently a mixture of dark spots & horizontal lines on the screen. I tried replying to an older thread but it was closed so I am distinguishing my model above. I'd been very happy before and though, oh I got lucky-- HP sorted out the hinge issue but apparently NOT. Needless to say, this computer has been very carefully handled, never dropped, & has hardly ever travels outside this house. I am shocked the hinge / screen can have spontaneously fall apart like that, however. When I left, the screen was left open and everything fine so whatever happened, it has nothing to do with opening & closing it now, per se. I'd greatly appreciate someone from the HP team contacting me about a repair without my needing to write to the various corporate people. Thanks in advance. I am in the U.S. btw & this was purchased brand new at Microcenter in my city.

Hi. The right-hand hinge on my notebook casing  - where the power connection is - came loose some time ago (a well-known issue with Envy, I think). Every time I opened the lid, the casing would come apart a few centimetres - and the power supply would always be switching between mains & battery. But now when I tape up the casing tight (no more gap when the lid is opened), there's no more connection to mains being made any more.Clearly the repeated action of the broken hinge has affected the power connection. Any simple fixes for this? If I need to take it for repairs, would it be a simple job (not costing hundreds)?Thanks...

I too have a broken hinge, and perhaps the other one waiting to break. The computer was purchased Dec 2018, so it is just barely out of the warranty period. Obviously this is a known issue to HP. There are so many complaints about this issue, it would seem only right that HP should have these computers fixed free of charge to their customers. We thought we were purchasing a quality brand only to find that at least these parts are so badly designed that they are breaking very quickly. This is not good customer service, or any way to keep customers returning to your products. This will make me question ever buying an HP again, even though I have for many years. The service center listed here is UBreakIFix,  so HP could easily have this fixed at the company's expense and not mine. I already paid for my laptop, and it should certainly not be breaking barely a year later. This has been frustrating, that there is no support for HP products except this. No phone, no email.

so August of 2020 I bought this laptop, and have absolutely loved it. today I went to open it and heard a CRUNCH, I looked in the bottom corner and the Screen is bending out next to the hinge, now it's out of warranty so i figure why not try and see if it is possible to repair. I take it apart and notice that the plastic that the hinge mounts to is just disintegrated. I haven't misused this laptop, it's never been dropped, i even bought a plastic cover for it to prevent the aluminum from getting scuffed. I google hinge problems for this model and low and behold it's a common issue that HP doesn't seem to care to fix or address. Here i sit with a disassembled laptop with a completely busted hinge that i am reluctant to replace since it seems like it'll just likely happen again... Absolute garbage that this happens quite frequently and because it's out of warranty HP wipes their hands of it... they say you must have dropped it or damaged it somehow, or you need to fix your manufacturing process... this is a multigenerational thing.

So, apparently HP has gotten away with this manufacturing defect on the Envy laptop hinge.  This was an expensive computer for me, and it started breaking apart about 2 years ago.  It's amazing that it is still working (somewhat) even though the left hinge is completely broken apart, and it is connected only with the hinge on the right side.  All of the plastic at the bottom of the screen is broken off, except about 4 inches around the right hinge. It has never been dropped or mistreated in any way.  I stopped at a local computer shop a year ago to inquire about getting it repaired.  As soon as I described the problem, I was told this was a known defect on those HP models, that people had already brought some of them in for repair, but they were not able to fix it.  I've purchased many HP products over the years, including laptops, desktops, and printers, not just for personal use, but for small business use.  Never again.  Clearly, quality control is not an important issue for HP.

Over time, the hinges on my laptop have snapped near the base and have detatched from the display panel, making it difficult to open and close the laptop, and sometimes the display panel will fall on either side, causing the hinge bases to stick out. I experienced a similar problem with the right hinge a couple months ago, and had it replaced. From what I've read, this is a common problem with HP laptops. The laptop is out of warranty, and I don't know if this is something that can be resolved, or if the only solution is to buy a replacement. I'd be grateful if you can offer any help and suggestions.

I bought the HP Envy x360 at the end of 2017 (September or October), so the warranty has ended.  Today I heard a click or crack.  I see that the hinge is pulling apart the body of the device, around the corner of the screen.  I picked this laptop because I thought it would be durable for simple desk usage, considering it was made to be flipped into a tablet when needed (I do not use it in that manner, I open and close the laptop as it sits on my desk, and that is the extent of mobility for this laptop). After opening and closing the laptop, I can see that the body of the laptop is splitting apart at the hinge.  I asked on Twitter what my options were and they sent me here.  Can the laptop be fixed, or do I just have to buy a new one?

Hello,I have an HP Envy x360 Convertible that is just under 2 years old and sustained a broken left hinge today. I was closing it gently and normally when there was a sound of crunched plastic and the hinge froze up, causing the top cover to push outward because it had become unattached from the hinge. One of the metal rivets and some small pieces of plastic where the rivet had been mounted to the lid fell out of the narrow gap between the screen and lid. I gently realigned the lid & screen with the hinge and have kept it open since this happened.I use this laptop only for personal use about 2 times a day and it has been extremely well-taken care of. I have only used the convertible rotation feature less than 10 times since I purchased it and given that this would be a very gently used personal laptop, I never would have felt that an extended warranty would be necessary for what I believed to be a quality product from this company.I am extremely unhappy about this happening considering it is the first and only laptop I have ever owned and I have had numerous HP desktops over the years with no issues. It appears that this is a common and known issue with these HP hinges over many years and yet the problem persists.I have been a dedicated HP customer for a long time and I hope that HP will help repair this issue, knowing that it has been a long-standing design problem. Thank you.

I bought my HP Envy in 2017 for university, unfortunately that means it is now out of warranty. One of the hinges is loose and pops out of place every time I open the laptop, which is quite concerning and means that I have had to try use other devices to do work for fear of this leading to a cable snapping or becoming damaged. I need this fixed before term starts again ideally so that I can continue to study well. Does anyone have any recommendations for a fix for this? It seems to be quite a common issue with HP Envys and is disappointing as I otherwise really like my laptop, but this is dissuading me from HPs a bit as I have taken measures to be careful with the laptop. I'm currently looking into prices for local repair services, but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

How may I get HP to take some accountability to help with a broken hinge on a ENVY 360 personal laptop, in doing some research I'm finding hundreds of people saying the exact same thing. We have not mistreated this laptop and it broke very easily and we are going to potentially lose all of out information. Is there someone to talk to regarding getting this fixed as it is an extremely common issue and it seems like a poor design on the actual Note book? Anyone have success with getting them to fix this?

I have this hinge problem again and again. This problem is not just mine. There are plenty of questions in the support forum. 
 
After just over 2years of my purchase of HP ENVY TS 15 Notebook PC, I am started having this problem. (Such a time.  just after warranty. Of course). From top right hinge which is just next to charging point lost crew suddenly and began to come loose every time I open and close the laptop and it is getting worse. Then it wasn't charging. I have contacted customer support team and I paid additional £150 to just fix the problem. But now I am having the same problem again. 
I was using my laptop very carefully and never dropped it. Even though a person who fixed my laptop must have seen it how well I kept it. 
 
Now I am thinking that this problem might be some manufactural issue. Hence, I really want to send back to have some quality inspection. 
 
PLEASE HP CONSIDER MY ISSUE AND TAKE SOME ACTION.

HP Envy.  My Pc was only 2 years old and the screen is detaching from the frame in the lower left corner.  It looks like a broken hinge (probably cheap plastic design).  In reading posts in this support community it sounds Like I am screwed.  It is out of warranty, but it is clearly a bad design.  When I open or close I always used two hands and did it carefully.  I probably only open/close about once a week.  This design is garbage - real bad.  I paid much more to get ""the top of the line and not a cheap PC"" so it would last longer.  I feel cheated. HP should fix this for free.  Will they?  Has anyone gotten this fixed for free?  Or fixed and how much did they charge you?  Did you have to ship the PC back to HP and how long did it take to get it back? Thanks Bob

Has anyone noted on here or found any info about this broken hinge issue?  it seam's to be a lot people  all over the net with this problem and HP knowing in advice about this and continued to sale and not fix it. It started Popping when i opened it and after i noticed a couple of days later when I looked at the back,  that it was actually popping open on the corner so I popped it back together and a couple days later the LCD screen look cracked when I opened it.. So I took it to a Repair guy and he said it wouldn't be worth trying to repair it and he's seen hundreds with this very iissue first hand and on the net doing research on the issue.  I've only owned this laptop for 14 months and not even 2  months out of warranty, (of course).  This should be a recall if they knew. Kinda sucks to spend 600.00 for a laptop they knew had issues!!!I'm going to see if there is any other people are law suits for this issue.Thank you for the RANT

The hinge has broken on my HP Envy x360, with no drops/damages and purely naturally started happening on its own. I can't even fold the laptop because the hinge prevents the lid from doing so. After some research I found that this is a common design flaw in many envy laptops. I have heard that many people have had their laptop fixed when, as this is a design flaw from factory and not related  to misuse of the laptop. Also, due to the hinge breaking the screen has become cracked as the hinge pushed through the screen. What is my best course of action here? Many thanks in advance

I noticed that many people are reporting this broken hinge issue, and it seems to be on more than just my model.  All of the other reports show resolved with no actual resolution.   Does HP plan to fix this issue or is there a recall of some sort? It seems to be a widely known defect at this point.  There are some YouTube videos showing a fix, but it does require completely disassembling the laptop and gluing the broken hinge into place.  Not a very good fix and not recommended unless you are very expert on the hardware.  Of course this would also violate any warranty, so I am not recommending it, just mentioning the fix is not an easy one and probably costly as lots of labor is involved in taking the laptop apart.   So HP, is there a solution coming???

I have an HP Notebook that is out warranty by 6 months. It's hinges have broken through no fault of mine and is causing the notebook to physically separate.

I have been using the HP Envy x360 convertible laptop for about 6 months and this is the fist issue I have had with it. Recently after using the laptop in tablet mode, I heard a loud crunch after rotating the screen back to the closed position. Upon opening up the laptop again, it was apparent that the right hinge popped out of place and did not rotate with the screen, which caused the the bottom right portion of the screen to crack due to it not closing properly. I was extremely confused what caused the damage because I was using the device exactly as intended. After a bit of research, it was clear that I am not alone and this seems to be a reoccurring issue with this model. I contacted customer support and was told that the damages were not covered under warranty and I would have to pay $400 (half of the original price) to get it repaired. It is absurd to me that this model is advertised to allow 360 degree rotation, but doing so will break the laptop after 6 months of usage. It is a complete scam to want $400 to repair a known defect of your product. Now the hinge is broken, a portion of the screen is cracked, and the laptop is unable to be folded back into tablet mode. I really need this laptop and do not have the funds to get it repaired, is there any other course of action I can take to get my laptop fixed?

The left hinge on my HP ENVY 17 laptop is broken and causes the the casing to come apart when opening. I continued to use the laptop with the problem as the casing could be held in place when opening and closing to prevent serious damage. However, small peices of plastic from either the hinge assembly or casing have broken off and caused the cooling fan to malfunction and displays an error message on startup. I am having some difficulties contacing whatever HP customer service to try to get this fixed.

So the left hinge broke on my laptop within the first 30 or so open and closes.  Looks like it ripped off the case.  The right hinge then also broke later so essentially nothing is holding on the screen portion of the laptop except three wires. Who do I contact to get this fixed?  My laptop is definately still under warrenty and broke fast enough that it's not a wear and tear issue.

I have a HP Envy laptop, roughly 15 months old and under warranty: as I opened the lid a few weeks ago there was a loud cracking noise from the left hinge so I closed it again. As I closed it some small bits fell out of the hinge area and a metal plate kind of popped out leaving the screen hanging off on one side. Naturally I contacted HP to have it fixed as it's under warranty but I've spent the last two weeks in protracted discussion as HP have accused me of ""clearly"" using ""force or misuse"" to cause this. Opening and closing a laptop lid isn't exactly a difficult skill and I seem to have managed pretty well over the last 20 years in not damaging any of the laptops I've used so I am completely bemused as to why HP think I am responsible for the damage.Further to this, I've Googled ""HP laptop broken hinge"" and there are countless cases of EXACTLY the same thing having happened to other people with exactly the same response from HP: not our problem!!What is the point of having a warranty if HP can simply absolve themselves from responsibility by saying ""you broke it""?!HP quoted me £315 to fix it; they then sent it back to me with a BROKEN SCREEN which it didn't have before (I have before and after photos)!! They have now stopped responding to my emails... Any ideas how this might be resolved?

I just bought my Envy 360 a few months ago and it's still under warranty. I treat this thing like my baby and haven't bumped into it/dropped it/ or anything and suddenly the left hinge is slightly out-of-line. Everything is still attached, there just seems to be something wrong with the lower left corner of my screen at the hinge.  Now I can't close my laptop and something with the left hinge is putting pressure on my screen as I can start to see warping colors along the bottom. I've seen a lot of people complain about this issue. If it's still under warranty (and with so many people complaining), has HP issued any sort or recall? I've had my old HP Pavillion for over 8 years and it did great. Then I buy the new Envy and a hinge breaks off in a few months. And according to HP Support Assistant, there aren't any HP service stores in Oahu that handle consumer notebooks, only commercial ones! Every time I try to find HP support on their website to try and contact them about this issue, it reroutes me to looking up HP service stores near me...but there aren't any, since there are none in Oahu. So I'm a bit stuck on how to proceed!

To whom it may concern, Kindly trying to reach out to HP Customer Service about an issue with my HP Evny x360 Laptop (CND03429CN), purchased in Augugst 2020. The Laptop has only been used for light office work and on a desk, was not dropped nor hampered with in any way. The right display hinge just broke and disintegrated, bending open the display caseing and rendering the folding mechanism non-operational. Display as such and laptop are still functioning.  I am very unpleased about this issue and inability to contact HP support in any other way than through this forum. While I appreciate the laptop being outside of warranty, which expired in September of this year, I cannot accept this damage. Please note that going through the formum there are a number of such repoirts of said hinge braking, as early as a few weeks/months after the initial purcase.  Kindly requesting a response and mitigation/repair plan. Kind regards,

I have an almost  two year old HP Envy 360 laptop whose left hinge just broke. When the hinge broke it popped the screen up and now the screen is not working correctly. I've read that this is quite a common problem with HP laptops. I can't believe that my $900 laptop has become unusable due to a poorly installed mechanical part. The laptop has never been dropped or mistreated.This is so unfortunate because it has been an awesome laptop that has always worked wonderfully. It seems as though HP will not acknowledge their poor engineering and craftmanship. There really is no excuse for a laptop to become nonfunctional because the manufacturer can't estimate the adequate hinge size, material, and installation to ensure that their product can be opened. This is really disheartening. I have used HP computers for nearly 20 years. Based on all the other posts it seems as though I will need to purchase a new laptop. Couldn't have happened at a worse time. I am in the middle of preparing my 3rd grade distant learning curriculum that needs to be taught due to Covid-19.

While trying to close my HP Envy x360, the plastic piece holding the screws in place on the right hinge fell out (i.e. disintegrated from poor quality) and cracked the screen. The laptop screen cannot be closed at all now.  The laptop has not been dropped or misused at all. It is astounding to me that this problem has been known and reported since at least 2015. HP literally has a video on their YouTube channel to show how to replace hinge panels. This is clearly a serious design flaw that needs to be addressed by HP, and they need to do something to restore trust in the quality of their products. Why has there not been a recall on these products yet? I am extremely angry that customers are expected to pay out of pocket for repairs when this is clearly a manufacturer defect. Had I known this was an issue, I would have never purchased an HP laptop.

I own three HP laptops and use them all.  About a year ago the left hinge on my HP 17 Notebook broke.  Everything still works but I can't really close the computer anymore without things bulging and popping and it is hard to get the charger in.  I shrugged and now use it basically as a desktop.  Last week, the left hinge on my older HP 15 Notebook (2016) broke.  It's basically the same situation.  I just wanted to get them fixed and came across all of these reports about defective hinges on HP laptops and even saw a recent class action suit filed against HP about it.  My screenname, Brokenwing2 is a reference to the two broken hinges.  The warrantee on both computers has long expired but as it appears HP has been well aware of a problem with its hinges, I'm hoping they do me right and offer me a fair way to fix both computers so I can use them as they were intended, as laptops.  I'm looking for any advice on how to get the broken computers fixed.   Thanks.

Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 (32-Bit). My laptop is no longer covered under manufacturer warranty  (less than 2 years old) but the hinge at the power cord has broken and the screen is separating.  This should in no way be in the state it is in with minimal handling.  Please assist in getting the necessary repair and or replacement as this issue seems to be a common compliant.

Unfortunately, over the weekend, the hinge of the screen on the lower right side of the laptop has loosened or an opening has appeared there so that the laptop can no longer be closed because the opening keeps expandingUntil now I have used my laptop very carefully and with an additional laptop bag to ensure that there is no damage. The brand HP, which is known worldwide and has very Qualitative products was one of the reasons why I decided to buy a laptop from this brand. There were a lot of laptops for a better price but for me, it was important to pay for a laptop of good quality.  Until now I was very satisfied with that product.Unfortunately, the opening of the frame and screen that occurred over the weekend, disappointed me and made me question how it comes to his problem, without any outside influence. In addition, I would also like to mention that I very rarely used the touch and screen rotation. I would not like to imagine what would have happened if I had used this more often. Yesterday I talked with the HP Hotline in Germany and they wanted to send pictures of the broken hinge and pictures of the screen. I sent the pictures through email and today the HP worker told me that there is nothing that the warranty could cover.They send me an offer to repair that for a price of 461,90 €. When I heard this price I was very shocked because, in my opinion, it is an exorbitant price because the price for new laptops is the same. I am a student in Germany and I am really very disappointed because during the pandemic situation and I have to write exams online and I have to write my thesis. I am lost. I cannot afford to pay the price they are asking for to repair the laptop although it is not even my fault and is clearly a manufacturing issue. I went on to do a little bit of research and sure enough, there were many, many other complaints of their HP Envy laptop’s hinge breaking through normal use. I am extremely upset with this issue.I thank you in advance and would be very happy to receive positive feedback from you. Here are a few of the other complaints: 1. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Envy-Left-Hinge-Broken/m-p/6979085...2. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Hinge-Popped-Open/m-p/...3. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-x360-15T-BP000-HINGE-I...4. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...5. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-left-hinge-HP-ENVY-x... My laptop hinge:

Hi, I have an issue with left hinge of my Envy x360 laptop. Hinge mounting has broken out of nowhere during normal usage of the laptop. Now the loose hinge pushes the screen as you can see in the photo. I see that there are numerous reports on exactly the same issue on this forum and it's clearly a design flaw rather than mistreatment.My warranty is fortunately still active, so I ask for contact from HP representative to solve this issue.

The left hinge has broken on my HP 17 laptop. I have had it 2 years and I take very good care of it. It has never been dropped.  I opened the screen and heard a cracking sound.  Small pieces of plastic fell out from behind the hinge. I can no longer close or open the lid without the casing around the screen pulling away.  I see from searching the forum that this is a major problem with these laptops. I would appreciate if someone from HP would contact me about how to repair these faulty hinges.

HP Envy x360 left hinge broken, screen splitting. This appears to be a common issue. I do not use this as a tablet so not switching between it and a laptop. This just happened yeaterday. Heard some cracking and checked it and see that it is coming apart in the left hand corner. It gets worse each time I open the laptop. There is now discoloration in the left hand corner of the screen. Is this something that HP will take care of. The laptop is under 2 years old and out of warrenty, of course. I need my laptop for work and cannot be without it for very long. I have seen several people say that they sent theirs in for repair from HP and it takes several weeks to get it back.  I have searched for support but nothing available until I can call tomorrow morning. Due to COVID it seems the are not as available as much to help or it will take longer to talk to someone or get a response. Please let me know if anyone has had any luck with this issue. Thank you

I have always enjoyed the quality of HP products but am a bit frustrated with the hinge breaking so easily.

I have had a HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx for roughly 2 years now. I have never had a problem with any other brands of laptop and damage not caused by myself. My laptops normally last 4-5 years, so after only 2 years the hinge breaking on this laptop is not acceptable.  I have seen many complaints about hp laptops and hinges breaking, and also complaints by customers stating hp knows about these faults and does nothing to stop them from happening. I rely on my laptop for every day work.  I cannot send it away to get repaired. Nor should I have to pay for damage which is clearly a design fault. If I do not get a reply on this platform from hp I will be contacting customer services and asking to speak to a supervisor to get this dealt with quickly. Thank you

I have had my Envy 17T since 2014.  I had the hinges repaired in 2016 under warranty.  They broke again in 2017 or 2018 and I applied an epoxy fix that has worked well until now.   I'm  now looking to replace my laptop to get more modern features.  This has been a good laptop except for the hinge problem. I've seen that HP has redesigned their hinges in the past year.I'm wondering of this redesign is more reliable/effective in preventing the broken hinge problem a lot of us have seen.  Does anyone have any feedback on the new hinge design?  Thanks!!

My wifi has been dropping for months. Did not seem to coincide with any changes or updates. Bios is latest & drivers all updated still not worked. System became unstable due to driver updates so rolled back. That did not help so refreshed win 10. That did not solve the wifi dropping. Seems driver related as driver stops the wifi. I rseated the wifi card as  #2 annentae fell off while I was checking so maybe the antennae was loose. Now its been ok for 3 1/2 hours!!!  Still 7260 is discontinued for support & driver problems will likely get worse. Can I install another intel wifi card.? Look toward AC 8260 or AC 8265. Read all 9000 series are out as config is different... Can anyone give me some advice? Thanks

So as I went to open my laptop I heard a loud crack and 3 screws popped out from the right hinge. The screen is functioning but is held away from the chassis by the broken hinge. HP are claiming I must've caused the damage and have quote me £315 to fix it despite it being under warranty! As an engineering student about to start my 4th year, it's so infuriating that they will not accept responsibility for this MAJOR design flaw. I have seen so many other posts with the exact same problem and HP refuse to accept that it is an issue. Having to pay nearly half the price of my laptop to fix an issue that is not my fault is ridiculous and I now don't know if I should be looking at buying an alternative product like a surface instead of doing the fix?

I called HP and they quoted an over 400.00 repair! What's up with that? I'm looking for help and hoped warranty would cover it, I've always loved HP and had great sucess dealing in customer support, but something seems very odd with this.

The hinge is broken on my HP Pavilion Gaming laptop and the frame is pulling away from the screen on the bottom right. I have read all of the problems other people are having getting the same problem resolved expediently and satisfactorily. I need someone to contact me asap, and I will not be put on hold forever just to be told that they need to transfer me to someone else, and that person does the same thing, and on and on. At the very least this is very poor customer support and service. People buy your computers because they're supposed to be reliable and not have an issue that is clearly caused by poorly designed and/or cheap parts. These computers are not cheap, and we expect not only sturdily built laptops, but ones that will last for a few years at the least without parts breaking that you obviously refuse to admit are defective to begin with, and then refusing to fix what is obviously of your own doing by using poorly designed and/or cheap parts. As a customer of yours, I expect my problem to be taken care of expediently and to my satisfaction. I do believe that there is power in numbers, and there are enough complaints for this apparently very large group to take other action on our behalf if this continual problem is not taken care of without us having to pay ridiculous sums of money to have you fix your problem, and without having to jump through hoops to try to speak with someone who can remedy this problem. I would think that as many complaints as you've had, you would have dedicated personnel to take care of this obviously very large problem. I expect to hear from someone who can take care of this for me in a timely manner. Regards

The left side hinge is broken and closing it puts stress on the screen creating separation. It has not been dropped or handled inappropriately.  It never really seemed to be as smooth opening and closing as other laptops I've had, but I did not realize the hinge was actually pulling loose.  I don't close it up very often.  In review of similar problems on this site, I see that the hinge problem has been going on for a while.   I purchased this laptop on March 9, 2018 so it is not even 1 week over the one year mark.

After reading everyone else's stories with the envy's faulty design with it's hinges, I decided to **bleep** and see what could be done for this issue with my computer.  I figured that maybe they would do something to address their design flaw, which was to offer me a 20 percent off repair fee of $317.  I will be taking others advice on here and get it fixed somewhere else.  Needless to say, I will never buy another HP laptop.  Thanks HP for backing your design!

My laptop that I bought 1n August 2019, started breaking apart due to just everyday normal use upon opening and closing, The hinge is broken and tearing the whole frame apart i can close it but only just and the laptop is falling apart in that corner.From what I read, this has been an ongoing issue in many of the HP laptops.I spent a lot of money on this gaming laptop for my 18 year old thinking it would last longer as I had purchased a premium product. I have never dropped or done anything to it physically. I take very good care of it. I feel HP should stand behind their product, and fix or replace this for me. Just over one year of owning and using just on a daily average basis, with no harm to it, it is just unacceptable. I know the one year warranty ran out  as soon as I realized the problem was just going to get worse.I paid around £1250 for this and expected it to last for a long time clearly it is a defect in quality, it is like the hinge has seized up. I would like a response from HP as clearly the quality of the external casing is not as good as the internal elements. My son is going to Uni soon and now has no laptop unless I buy another. I don't feel I should have to after spending so much.

[personal information removed] Product number: G1V01UA  I attached a couple pictures of a broken hinge on my laptop.  It looks pretty bad -- is there any way to replace or repair this?  I'd like to continue using the laptop if possible.  Thanks!

I had purchased a HP laptop on 23rd July 2018 from Reliance Digital Bangalore. Laptop Description : HP Gaming Pavilion - 15-xx0140xxCost : Rs 73,053/- After one and half year of purchase.  From the last week of March 2020, I was  facing the problem during opening and closing of the laptop ( breaking sound with small pieces of plastic material coming out ).    Then, On 13th May 2020 I gave my laptop in the service center as recommended by HP support, TVS Electronics Ltd.(HP Authorized Service Partner)F-2, No-9, 27th Cross, 8th B Main4th Block, Jayanagar, Bangalore -560011 After 2 weeks on 27th May 2020, I have received a quotation from the service center saying ""the hinges are broken and we need to replace hinges and LCD back cover which cost Rs 12,272 /- "". And they are giving a warranty of only 90 days from the date of replacement. First I thought only I have this problem. After a search many have the same problem with this type of laptop.  https://youtu.be/79Nb-e3IIS4 One person got the same problem and replaced it and after few months he got same problem again. We give such a huge amount (Rs 73,053) for the laptop thinking about the good quality, software and the good brand. And later without our fault, if we continue to have such a problem, how can we spend Rs 12,272/- for the replacement every time.  So, I would request you to give me a reason why the problem occurs and give me an solution.

My laptop is just over 1 year old.. All of a sudden the  hinges have become disconnected from the screen.It appears that the screws no longer stay in their little holes in the plastic and they've all fallen out completely. As a result the screen is no longer able to stay up under it's own weight and I am very concerned that this will lead to further damage to the laptop. Through searching on forums including this one, it appears this is a common issue and a simple search on the internet will show. What is the suggested response to this ? Since this is clearly NOT because of my mis-handling of the laptop, as I have not had anything happened like this to me before having used laptops for over 25 years. Other than this design flaw, i dont have any other issue with the laptop and works perfectly. Is there something that HP can do to rectify this ? ThanksChi

I have had my 13 inch HP envy for 1.5 years. I brought through currys so no manufacturer warranty but I did pay for a year warranty which has now expired. I paid £900 for this and when I closed the lid the other day I heard a metal cracking sound. The hinge is completely broken to the point the lid, screen and hinge has all come apart and a screw of some kind from the hinge has damaged the touchscreen to the point it no longer works.

The hinge on the right side of my laptop has somewhat broken. When I open my laptop, the hinge pops off and the bottom right corner of the plastic piece around my screen comes off the laptop. This has caused a few small screws to come out of the bottom corner. I am to the point where the corner of the plastic piece is not able to stay around the screen without slightly coming off.

I bought my HP Envy x360 Convertible last 2020 and I didn't encounter any issues with it. However, for the past couple weeks, I've noticed a change in my screen just right on top of my left hinge that the color looks different than the rest of the screen. The change of color is more evident when the HP screen is loading. At first, I thought it was just a matter of lighting in my room until today, when I was finished with my work on my laptop and tried to close it, I heard some clicking sounds. I immediately stopped and checked whether it was my laptop and it turns out its the left bottom screen that has lifted and the left hinge seemed lose that I could lift the screen up. Now, I can't fully close my laptop because the clicking sounds gets worse when I close it and the screen lifts more. I have never dropped my laptop at least once nor do I aggressively lift the screen. My warranty has already expired and I don't know what to do. I've also searched and turns out it was a manufacturer error. Can someone please help me? I really need my laptop ;-;

I have become a victim of the seemingly common problem of broken hinges with HP Laptops. Their customer service is impenetrable so I'm hoping to get some help here. The laptop is just out of warranty, however when I purchased the laptop through the student store it was supposed to come with three years warranty for free, but this never materialised. I only noticed the damaged hinges a couple of days ago. Does anyone know how long I have before the whole thing breaks irrepairably and is their anyway I can fix this myself? I can't afford a replacement laptop. Quite shocked by this, the laptop was expensive and is very well reviewed. Thank you.

Hi,  The left hinge on my laptop is completely broken. I haven't had this laptop for long and I take very good care of it. I don't even use the convertible tablet. For my laptop to completely break apart from the hinge and plastic piece, it is very unreliable. I know others have had the same issue. How do I fix this? If I were to get this fixed would it just break apart again because of the faulty engineering of this line of laptops? It is very concerning for me and I need a reliable laptop for my line of work. Is there a refund? Or can HP help with all of us having this issue?

Despite never being dropped, the hinge on the left has broken behind the screen and is separating the screen from the cover.   I have another HP laptop that’s close to 10 years old and the hinges work perfect.  Disappointed that the new one has a design flaw that makes it essentially worthless after less than two years.

I closed my laptop last night and the hinge made a popping sound. The right hinge came loose and the screws or rivets fell out. It works but I am afraid to use it. I am also a disabled vet and on limited income. This laptop was purchased with my rehab funds to let me attend school and use for my Disabled Vet online meetings. This appears to be a common issue and I have always been careful with my laptop. Is there a way for HP to please repair this for me as a known issue? Thank you,Charles

When I closed my laptop earlier, the right hinge broke to where I cannot open it again or fully close it the remaining couple of inches. A couple shards of plastic broke off, too. There is now a gap between the inner and outer casing around my screen where it connects to the hinge. How do I go about fixing this?

I've been researching and found some many related issues the hinge and screen coming apart. This seems that HP has a device design flaw which causes the hinges to become weak and push the screen out and in my case it cracked (which is what happened to me). This laptop has never been dropped or mishandled. It literally happened when I opened my laptop from the closed position.  Which is ridiculous that I have to keep my laptop open at all times now because it continues to destroy the hinges/screen even more if I attempt to close it. This is now a complete disaster since I work from home  needing to use my laptop and  can't use it  properly due to the touchscreen is constantly doing its own thing. I am beyond livid that I have seen people with the SAME EXACT ISSUE. Why isn't HP recalling or bringing any light to this manufacturing problem?  I refuse to pay for HP to replace this at a cost to me. I have had this laptop for 2 years and of course its out of warranty. I would like someone to contact me to resolve this issue and I would request that  HP picks up the cost for the issue or replaces with a new HP laptop that is functional. I don't have money to spend on a new laptop when this  is obviously an HP manufacturing problem and not a consumer issue (since so many people have the same problem). I have taken nothing but great care for my WORK laptop.  If HP does not work with me on fixing this issue I will be contacting an attorney and open a class action lawsuit due to the lack of design functionally  which creates an issue where the hinges are now pushing the screen out. This isn't just a me issue, several hundred people have complained. I was also never made aware that this design when I purchased it was having issue with the charger getting too hot and causing fires. This also opens up an issue since right where the charger goes is right where the issue of the screen pushed out.  Please contact me in resolving this issue or I will proceed in filing the lawsuit. This item should be recalled and people should be refunded their money. This is a very dangerous issue to have.

The pastic case that surrounds the keyboard part of my laptop is starting to pop up and off near the hinge for the screen, in the top, right corner.

I rarely close this laptop and have never mishandled it, dropped it, or anything that should cause this to happen - and in such a short amount of time. Clearly the hinges HP uses are crap. I Googled and know now that this is a VERY common issue with HP Laptops. This is my 2nd one where this has happened JUST after the 1 year warrantly expired. I called and they quoted me around $250 to fix.

I called customer support and they blamed me for this manufacturer defect and refused to help me. I have been a long-time HP consumer and after this experience, I am having second thoughts about the company. I purchased several of this model of touchscreen HP laptops for my daughters and myself, and each one has had a hinge problem. This one that I currently have has rarely been used and will not shut due to the hinge issue. It is no longer under warranty but since this is a manufacturer defect, it should be repaired regardless.

I have a broken hinge on the right side of the scanner cover of an HP Officejet Pro 8610 printer.  A company called Mara Import Services says they can fix it for $170.  I paid $100 (on sale) for the printer about 6 years ago.  The printer still works but awkward to lift scanner cover with the broken hinge.  I still have quite a few extra 950 (black) and 951 (colored) cartridges for the printer.  Best Buy and Office Max can't fix it nor do they know of any other printers that use those cartridges.  Does anyone know if that model is still available somewhere or another model that would use those cartridges?  Otherwise, my options as I see it are:  pay the fee to repair the printer and keep it;  live with it the way it is now until I use up my cartridges and buy a new printer with different cartridges; or bite the bullet now and get a new printer/cartridges.

 Hello! I purchased a HP Pavilion 14-ce0502sa laptop in late 2018. Today I noticed the left hinge has become detached from the chassis, causing the bottom panel of the laptop to be under a lot of strain and not in the correct position. The 3 screws which should hold the hinge in place have ripped away from the plastic. it seems that the plastic was never going to tolerate the hinge and that it is rather poorly designed. The attached image shows the broken plastic clearly visible after I removed the bottom panel, the hinge was free to move and causing the laptop to not close properly. I am aware I am quite far outside warranty but I think it's quite ridiculous that it has failed in this way.

Owing to numerous repairs over the year, the intenral plastic mount for the right hinge of my HP Envy 15 J163ei laptop screen has broken. The screws can no longer hold the right hinge in place and thus the right portion of my LCD has become damaged from the excess freedom of movment. I would like to repair the screen (which I am able to do) but without replacing the internal plastic mount the new LCD will just get damaged again. Does anyone know what the part number is for the plastic mount and is it possible to get a replacement part for it so I can install a new LCD without worrying about damaging it? The SKU number for my laptop is F7R42EA, if that is useful.

Sadly, I join a group of many other HP Omen purchaser who have hinge problems that have scared, broken, and altered their laptops. My Omen 17-w gaming laptop did just the same. I bought a special back pack for my expensive purchase to keep it safe. But to no avail, not only did my laptop hinges break on both sides of my screen but my warranty ended before I could use it as well. Then the cherry on top is how many people have shared the same complaint online as far back as 2017 to my knowledge because there are bound to be more. My head hurts with the fact that HP knew and did not correct this issue in the appropriate time frame. The lack of support online for this issue is crazy with so many people having it. I would of thought that at least a repair video would of been made. If there is one then I have not found it and I have been on the search for two days looking for an HP OMEN 17-w hinge repair video and have not found one. How can I have my laptop hinges loosened so that I can use it? Also my wifi connector cords are cut when the screen on the right side disconnected so what is the correct term for those items? I'm tired of looking around online to find no support or information to solve my problems that HP has known about for three years.

I have owned two different type of laptops from HP that have both experienced the same issue. I an now highly frustrated with the lack of accountability on HPs part. Years ago I purchased an HP Envy Touchsmart 17in notebook. I owned it for only a little over two years before I noticed the back hinges started breaking and the backing of the laptop was coming off as well. There were also loose parts inside as it rattles when you move it around. I did tend to open and close it a lot so i did not think too much about it and it had a fairly large screen. So with it being out of warranty, I decided the get a new laptop and did not do really any research to realize that this is a reoccurring issue. I then bought another HP Laptop model 17 by-1022ci. Again about 6 months after the two year warranty is up this laptops back hinges have begun to separate from the back as well. With this laptop I do not close it or open very often at all and I mostly only use it to watch TV shows or Netflix. This time I decided to call HP and see if there was anything that could be done. However the only option that the lady gave when I called was that I could send it in for repair for $325. I really annoyed at the lack of customer service for a loyal customer who has bought two laptops at full price and and has experienced the SAME exact issue on two different type of laptops.  Has anyone else had the same issue of the back hinges breaking and causing separating? Because it cant just be a fluke that the two laptops that i have owned by HP have the same issue.

Had the left hinge replaced when it failed withing warranty period.  Warranty ended late September this year (2020)  and now the right hinge has failed .  THis is a disgrace on the part of HP who know full well the failures relating to the hinges on  their Notebooks.  The hinge that has now failed should have been rerplaced at the same time as the first broken one. I do like this Notebook but at the moment I wouldn`t even think of having another HP  product.   Is there any redress against HP regarding these issues

Hi,I have bought a laptop from Currys pc world (UK) which now has a broken hinge and the bezel is coming unglued from the screen (with light use, poor design).I have 5 months left of extended warranty HP care pack. When trying to contact HP via the app on laptop and I enter UK as purchase location I am directed to Currys pc world support. However, they are saying I have no warranty with them so they will not repair or replace.Did I waste my money on the HP extended warranty ?Can I get it repaired through warranty?If not will HP refund the money I spent on the warranty?Thx for any advise how to resolve this situation.

Hi all, My HP Pavilion x360 laptop has been working perfectly fine for a few years now. I went to use it yesterday and heard a cracking noise while opening it - I noticed the screen/display panel bulging out in the lower right hand corner. After looking up the issue online, it seems like it is a known issue with the hinges. So it seems like a need the right hinge replaced. I am looking for any information on how I can get this part replaced or for the part number information so that I can order and replace it myself. Unfortunately, my product's warranty has expired. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

My daughter’s laptop, which she received as a Christmas gift last year, is falling apart at the hinges. Both hinges have broken and the screen is now dislocated from the keyboard.

I took it back to Sam’s Club but I was told any warranty must be honored by HP.

Dear HP Customer Support / HP Community.  I have a January 2020 Manufactured HP ENVY x360 PC purchased form Computer Micro Centers (Yonkers NY).  The warranty period is over - that's another story for later...  I now have the right Hinge Broken problem that many have setforth here Plus the Monitor screen is Detaching from the PC as I attempt to close it.  I'm not trying to Flip it into Notepad mode, that would probably finish it entirely.  Whatta Piece of ***bleep*** !!!  I purchased this particular PC in a scramble in the waning moments having to have a Laptop at Home for working at Home.  Purchased in on March 17, 2020.  It has NEVER been used in Note pad mode, never been dropped or other wise abused in any manner....  
Moreover, per my above reference, after purchasing the PC form a quality Computer Store (MIcro Computer Centers), in Yonkers NY , I called HP to register it.  The rep told me that 1 year Warranty takes affect form the date of Manufacture , NOT the date of Purchase.  I pretested profusely, to no avail....""That's The HP policy""  as I was told. I was incredulous at the statement; when you buy new ANYTHING - cars, appliances, etc., and file the Warranty, it is ALWAYS form the date of Purchase?  It's no matter because even if I had the HP warranty it expired in March 2021.  So now I am victim of Functional Obsolesce.  I have owned with this PC , 4 HP PC products, and except for poor;y designed and functioning cooling fans on the Pavillon models, never had a problem close to this.  I WON""T BUY HP AGAIN !!!  It will cost me half , if not more to fix this    thing, NO Way.  HP, Please make Good here , keep your customers .  Aldo M.

Similiar to other posters, the screen and hinge on the right side of the HP ENVY x360 is separated form the Body of the pc.  It is only 17 months old, and has not been operated in a Note pad mode ever !!.  I used it solely as a desktop PC .  This is a terrible example of the JUNK quality of HP products ..  I have owned at least 4 HP Laptops (this being 1 of the 4), none of the other 3 were ever this bad.  WHAT IS HP GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS ?????  I had to scotch tape the screen corner so it doesn't completely separate from the body at the notorious right Corner , which is exactly what others have posted - the right corner.  I will be looking elsewhere for PCs in the future ..........

I bought a HP Pavilion 14 about 2 years ago now (maybe less) and I always make sure to look after it. A few months ago I noticed that the screen was starting to peel off a little on the bottom right. It did not seem like a major issue and was barely noticeable, but for someone who takes good care of their laptop, I noticed it. But, now it appears the right hinge has broken completely (literally snapped in half) which I am shocked by because I am often gentle with it. I don't know when or how it broken but it was suddenly. Now, I can't close or open the screen without the screen feeling like its going to rip/peel off. I've been a loyal customer to HP for years now, and I feel really stressed because I can't afford to get it fixed/a new one and am currently applying to jobs so it's a very stressful time. Does anyone know what I can do? Has anyone else had this same issue?

Hello,The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner, and one screw fell out together with some small, plastic pieces.My warranty ran out last September (2018). I moved the laptop an inch to the right, and the hinge broke. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way, instead of taking excellent care of it, considering I had to pay close to $1,300 for it. Based on the tons of complaints around this same problem on this forum (and elsewhere), it is evident that the hinge design is inferior.I am not pleased with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem.A computer in this price range should not break after just more than two years of regular usage!  I use this computer for my business, and this seems like a design problem.  From community boards, this appears to primary problem every purchaser has experienced.  I love this computer and feel in every way it 's has been an exceptional product.  I have only purchased HP product over the past 20 years,

Recently the screen started popping out of my laptop upon opening and closing it. Upon a closer inspection it turned out that the screw holes that keep the hinge in place broke within the laptop. To my dismay it turns out HP decided that a thin plastic screw hole would be be enough to hold a metal hinge and screw for years to come. The hardware inside is fine, everything is working however everytiime I open and close it I can hear the hinge snap and pop rubbing against the hardware inside. While it may work now im concerned that this can lead to probelms with the screen or hardware later on down the line.  My question is that since this is not a physical defect rather a poor choice of materials by HP is the anyway I could get them to fix it? I've tried getting in contact with someone for a solid 30 minutes now however it seems that they now want you to pay for customer service if your computer is out of warranty. Something that had I have known would have definitely not brought an HP (honestly I'm still baffled how HP thinks this is customer friendly). I have also tried seeing if there was anyway to just purchase the shell of the laptop and move my hardware over as ive said the hardware inside is fine its the shell and the hinges that are causing an issue. However I cant seem to find anything on it.

The left hinge of my HP Envy x360 laptop broke, and shortly after it it did the touch screen shattered.  Searching the forum it appears to me that this is a design flaw in the hinge for the Envy x360 series.  I've found several posts with the exact same problem.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Quality-issues-with-Envy-x360-...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Breaking-hinge-on-HP-EN...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...However a few of the above posts imply that HP may be doing something about remediation for those affected by this apparent design flaw. I believe my laptop is out of warranty which probably means I have no recourse other than to pay out of pocket for the repair.  However the parts aren't even listed as available on the HP Parts store.  I'm leery of purchasing OEM parts from a 3rd party vendor. Up until this hinge broke I was very happy with the laptop. I even recommended it as a purchase to several people. I've since gone back and rescinded that recommendation because of this design flaw.  Unfortunately one of the people I referred did buy the same model.  I've notified them of this problem.

I have taken care of this laptop and considering its just over 2 years old this issue shouldn't be occuring.

With the number of people facing this issue its clear that this is a fault in their product and I will be now contacting Financial ombudsman services and Financial conduct authority as they lack product integrity.

The hinge has given out on my laptop. I am an returning HP customer from back when I had HP DV9000 - to my current Envy X360 I usually go with Hp when it comes to windows OS as they make amazing computers. I bought this laptop directly from HP store in 2018. I have contacted hp and do have a case number however I cannot afford to pay for repair especially given the fact that it occured naturally. I am extremely dissappointed why a £1000 laptop has such a major flaw.After some research I found that this is a common design flaw in many envy laptops.Here are few of the other complaints; 1. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Envy-Left-Hinge-Broken/m-p/6979085...2. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Hinge-Popped-Open/m-p/...3. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-x360-15T-BP000-HINGE-I...4. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...5. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-left-hinge-HP-ENVY-x...   My Laptop hinge:  Spoiler (Highlight to read)Spoiler (Highlight to read)Hinge Spoiler (Highlight to read)Broken  Hinge Broken

Hi!  I've had my HP ENVY x360 (model 15m-bp111dx) for two years, and never dropped it or had any hardware issues up until now. A few weeks ago when opening the laptop the bottom left hinge would click and the front face of the screen would pop out. Initially it would be a small deflection. However, now the screen has popped out farther than I'm comfortable messing with, and can't close the laptop without it getting worse. The screen still works.  This seems to be a recurring issue that others have had. Please contact me with any steps I can take in repairing it. Thank you!

The right corner of my laptop's shell has cracked open and it won't hold the hinge or power jack in place. As an unfortunate side effect to things moving around in there, the computer will sometimes stop charging when I have the charger in, especially if I move the screen. Either way, I'll probably have to deal with the broken case first.What can be done to fix this and as I can see this seems to be a common problem for the Omen, it surprising an HP product would have this type of problem and seems as if no way for consumers to address this issue.Are there any solutions? or some type of help from HP since this is such a common issue?I'd really appreciate any possibilities, tips, or suggestions y'all have, and I wish you a pleasant day!

Long story short, my wife's laptop fell and cracked it's casing/shell near the screen hinge as pictured below. Luckily the laptop appears to be functioning normally, but we'd still like to repair/replace the broken piece. What options do we even have, (either having it sent in, buying a replacement piece ourselves, etc...) and how much would it likely cost?

Since 2005 I've always depended on an Hp Laptop. Some came with remotes and this last one was such a beauty to look at. I bought it over knowing it had all the options I needed it to complete  daily activities and run a small business. The computer  quickly began  having an issue with the hinge. The u unusual stiffness and other mechanisms I cant explain lead to a crack in frame and somehow is effecting the screen to have faded or blank areas.  This Laptop only had 25%of my usual workload with other HP LAPTOPS.  Every time I used the laptop now, it is drastically  loosing it's  ability to handle any workload. I put it down for some time now and barely open it. My productivity is at an all time low. I was looking to buy another laptop and was torn between repairing this laptop. I see the new series Omen has a single hinged design. Upon more research, I see that my laptop design is definitely  Defective!What are my Options? I know I'm way past warranty but no one could tell me ahead of time that a gaming Hp laptop could not last 2years  living a decent life. 1. I would like to send it back and get an upgraded version.2. Please somebody reach out because I need a laptop yesterday and cant afford the next choice not to live up to the quality  I was used  to.

Good morning HP support, I use an HP EliteBook 1030 G3 x360. few months ago, the left hinge got bad and eventually affected the left side of the screen (it got broken). I tried to get a replacement screen here in Nigeria but I haven't been able to find the right one. The right half of the screen was working but I noticed that after trying to fix replacement screens which were not working, my laptop wasn't charging and the battery was indicating o%. To use it, I have to plug it in power. Over some time, I wasn't able to use the laptop due to power outage, and when power was eventually restored, I tried switching on the laptop, but it refused to start up. The power indicator is not coming on at all. I also noticed that an area of the motherboard was getting overheated whenever in plug it in, and the fans were not rolling. Please, what can I do to solve this problem?

Anyone else have a problem with the display hinges on the HP Pavilion x360 coming apart ? With my laptop, the lcd screen detached from the back lid without getting dropped or mishandled in anyway . Laptop stays put in one place actually. Simply used it one day and the next day when I opened it, it let out a horrible creaking sound. The display had come apart and was ‘drooping’ on one side. A few days later (with me not using it) the screen has gone black but displays on an external monitor. For reference  I bought slightly over a year ago ( so I’m out of warranty).  Laptop has had issues from the go. First it was the wireless/Wifi  hardware two weeks after I bought. HP support wanted me to part with cash to get it fixed. I refused because laptop was just out of the shop. Contacted HQ and they fixed it after chasing them down for weeks. Now this has happened and I am tired! Same issue with HP Envy laptops from different threads and forums. Why the flimsy machines? For the amount I spent on this product, I expected it to work without issues for a long time. Highly disappointed and advising anyone I know not to invest in HP laptops. Would definitely want to fix though as I’m not about to invest in another laptop. Will HP help or should I just find someone else to do it?

Hello I went through some community posts and found that my issue is actually common which make it more obvious that the problem is the poor quality parts and faulty manufacturing of this laptop Two days ago, I opened my laptop and one of the hinges popped out and that caused the screen to crack from the bottom corner. The laptop has never been dropped or anything. I was opening it normally and that happened. I have an hp care extended warranty which has 18 months left and I have been communicating with hp customer support for 2 days now and they keep insisting that it is my fault and that I have to pay for the repair. How is your poor quality product is my fault?! I had an Asus laptop before for around 4 years and I didn't have a single issue, it was also a touch screen 365 convertible, I guess it was a huge mistake switching to hp. It is quite upsetting to see how common the issue is and still hp doesn't even want to honour their own faulty products. Horrible experience really

I bought an HP Notebook - 17-by1061st in April of 2020.  Almost exactly a year later, the hinge broke and black pieces of plastic were spitting out of the back.  The keyboard up near the power jack was cracking so I taped it with gorilla tape.  I discovered the laptop was not under warranty even though I was invited to extend my warranty through a popup invite on my computer.  HP even took my $59.99 or whatever it was for the extended warranty but then told me I didn't have an extended warranty when I complained that my laptop broke after a year.  Since then I have been using my laptop pretty much as a desktop, left open and never closed, on a desk, so it does not become completely unusable.  (Also, it is only with great effort that my laptop screen can be closed so I have stopped doing this at all.)  My computer works but ... it is broken and I have finally decided that I need to get it fixed, even if it costs me hundreds of dollars.  I have learned online that the cheap and defective hinge issue was known to be a problem as many as five years ago but was not fixed by HP.  This has resulted in a class action suit against the company in at least one state, Florida.   My question is:  how do I get my hardware fixed/replaced and how much will it cost me?  And my secondary question is:  is there any point in trying to convince HP to fix or replace my laptop with no charge given that they KNEW they had defective parts, i.e., the cheap hinge?   Thanks.

Hello,The left hinge came off the back cover. I sent the laptop to the authorized service but they said that this defect is not part of the warranty. The warranty is extended so the laptop is still under warranty. I would like to know if this type of defect is part of the warranty.

						I have a spectre X-360 convertible I opened it up and watch the spring or something behind the hinge break the screen and Crack across from the bottom right-hand corner. It just sits on my desk no falls or abuse. Just opened it. I am 100 days past the warranty. Obviously this is not anecessary unusual issue. I have found that with my first search inquiry about it. I turned off the touch screen so I could continue using it. I used the computer to generate a case number and called support. The employee was so extremely rude. Yes my warranty is up. But I may buy another product from HP in the future. Should treat the callers better. Anyways I finally was able to get a couple words in and told him I would try another support option. What options do I have with this common problem. Is it on a recall for CPSC or anything. Any info would help.

The right hinge of my hp notebook is breaking the case and I cannot properly open and close the display. I am really angry with the hp customer service as they want me to pay for their design fault.This issue has been reported in this forum many times over. One can expect that the case can hold the hinge. It is rediculous and one can see how poorly the hp notebooks are designed and how weak the plastic is. Dear HP Team, I please you to fix the issue within 14 days. If I do not get an offer to repair the issue within 14 days I will file a complaint with the European Commission. Moreover, I will post reviews with these photos attached on Amazon and all major retail channels and note that all HP notebooks can have the hinge problem within a short time period and that HP is reluctant to repair their own production and design error.Repair it now!!

I have had this Envy for just 15 months and both hinges have snapped (to HP's credit, the hinges have not come away from the plastic on the screen cover or the base, the actual metal hinge has snapped and when I look at it, the metal connection is not very thick).  I have resigned myself to buying expensive parts and spending hours repairing it, but I have found that no parts are available for purchase anywhere - I cannot buy the hinges themselves and even the entire screen assembly plus hinges is not available.  Does anyone know where I can find these?

My  Computer has never been dropped and the left hinge caused the screen of by computer to crack.  The computer was working fine up until yesterday and this happens.  I had a feeling this type of computer would have this type of problem but had no idea the computer was poorly made even though I bought it brand new.  These people are selling these computers with a lifespan to break and tear up once the warranty is expired.  They will stop supporting any computer after 3 to 4 years of use and  it just falls apart.  They are built that way so these greedy people can make more money.  I have decided to never buy a computer manufactured from this company ever again and I will do my due diligence to find any brand that they build under any other name.  It is sad though.  I was a PC person but I think it is time to twitch over to APPLE.  There computers are made to last.  It might be a bit expensive but at least they are well build and will not fall apart and they continue to support their products for many years past what HP consider to be disposable and they stop supporting it.  It is sad that American Computers are just that, made to tear up and thrown to the dump after a 3 years of use.   I will never buy another HP and I am going on my Social Media Platform to tell all my 5000 people to share t photo of the damage on my computer due to a hinge breaking my screen.  Just think it could have came off and broken my foot or a little child handling this computer.  I also found out too that the batter is subject to explode when I did a google search.  I HP to see if there are any recalls and they said "" No"".  My google searches led to me finding that many people had made the same complaints about the hinge and the battery.  When I called they said there are no recalls on the computer.  I contacted consumer affairs and they said they are awaiting a response from HP.  I provided them the photos of the damage to my computer.  I will file complaint with the Federal Trade commission next and also as many government agencies as possible to let them know what happened.  Meanwhile, I am also getting ready to get my lawyer to contact them.

HP Pavilion x360 - 14-cd0050tuMy wife uses this laptop daily on a desk and had never used the screen rotation feature until yesterday when she opened the display to tablet mode. When fully opened to tablet mode there was an immediate small cracking noise from the display, just above the right hand facing hinge. When the screen was returned to normal laptop position, the display screen protruded and cracked just above the right hand facing hinge. Two screws and pieces of plastic fell out as well. Looking at the screws it was clear the bushels the screws screw into, had broken the plastic on the display back cover. The screws were still screwed firmly into the bushels but the plastic around the bushels had given way (see photo of the 2 screws). This is a common design fault of not just this model but several HP models in the past. I am a retired HPE and spent several years repairing HP laptops under warranty and HP authorization. This damage has been caused by a component failure and not user induced damage. The laptop is outside the one year standard warranty but considering that such a major component has failed within 2 years of purchase, through no fault of the eu and there are dozens of similar posts on this forum, HP should cover this repair.

Thanks guys! I can't believe the terrible customer responses of this company, or the complete inability to fix their products.  I should be more surprised if this was my first problem, but frankly after the number of support cases I've opened in the past 2 years it's just standard operating procedure for these guys.  I can honestly say I've bought my last HP product.

HP Envy Touchsmart 17, model: m7-j120dx, product: e8a11ua#aba. My friend, who is wheelchair bound, asked me to check out his laptop because the hinge was loose.  Upon examining it I see that the hinge appears to be loose and seperating the back and front so that there is a substancial gap. There are loose parts inside as it rattles when you move it around. When his laptop started giving him trouble from this issue, he set it aside and went out and bought a new HP Touchsart 17 at full retail price and started using that. Now his newer Touchsmart 17 is doing the exact same thing. He told me that his current laptop is still covered under a Geek Squad warranty but the warranty on his old one has expired since he put it in the closet and did nothing with it.Looking online about this issue I see thousands of customers having identical issues. I am thinking this is a material defect issue if there are this many loose or broken hinges/backplates.My friend is a trusting individual who doesn't want to point out a problem. PURCHASED TWO OF THESE AT FULL RETAIL PRICE!!! I told him he should get his current laptop to Geek Squad ASAP because they will repair it for him. My question is: Is there a recall on these or is HP standing behind this issue in any way? I really don't think he should just accept that his laptops fall apart and he goes and buys a new one.

My new Spectre 13t-aw100 CTO (custom build with OLED screen) has slow wifi: my other devices get 10Mbs on my home network, but the Spectre gets only 1Mbs. I think the issue may be related to Intel's wifi driver. The driver generates the error message ""Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37) The request is not supported"" when booted in Safe Mode with Networking. Detailed instructions are below. I don't know if the error message is normal, or if it is indicative of a hardware or software failure, but I suspect it is a software failure in the driver. If your machine does not already have the latest 10/6/2019 version 21.50.1.1 of the Intel driver, there are instructions for installing it on the ""Spectre X360 AX201"" thread. That thread also has several solutions for slow wifi problems that have worked for other users. However, the solutions did not work for my machine so I have posted this information on this new thread. I worked around the problem by using an external USB Wifi adapter (TPLINK, under $20 at Office Depot). Hopefully, an Intel driver update will fix the problem.More detailed instructions for reproducing the error message: 1) Make sure that you are displaying your desktop on ""PC Screen Only"".2) Shut down.3) Disconnect all external devices and cables.4) Press the Power button.5) Immediately start tapping the ESC key until you see ""ESC...Pause Startup"" in the lower left corner of the screen.6) Press F11 for ""System Recovery"".7) Select ""Troubleshoot"" (use the TAB and ENTER keys, or the touchpad). Select ""Advanced Options"".9) Select ""Start Settings"" (not ""Startup Repair"").10) Select ""Restart"".11) Your screen will go blank for a few seconds.12) Select ""Enable Safe Mode with Networking"" using F5 or 5.13) Your computer will reboot into ""Safe Mode with Networking"".14) Press WINDOWS+S (the Windows icon key and the S key).15) The search menu should appear.16) Type ""device manager"" and hit the ENTER key.17) The Device Manager dialog box should appear.18) Expand the ""Network Adapters"" category, if it is not already expanded.19) Open the properties box for the ""Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz"" (double click or click and press ENTER).20) On the ""General"" tab under ""Device Status"" my machine displays the error message:""Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37) The request is not supported"".21) On the ""Driver"" tab, it lists the build date as 10/6/2019, and the version as 21.50.1.1.22) Shut down.23) Reconnect any external devices or cables.24) Press the Power button to power back up normally.

Hi, in recent days I've found the laptop getting tougher to open and then yesterday, the plastic where the hinge screws go into have all broken away so now there's nothing to screw in to. I obviously can't open/close th3 laptop now as it's held by one hinge. Looks like I'm gping to need a new case (palm rest) are these available to purchase? Since this has happened I have learnt that this is a common fault which hugely disappointing in a £1000 laptop. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I opened my HP Envy x360 and the right hinge just broke completely out of the screen. The screen now has lines going across it and flickers. My warrantee ended a month ago, but the build quality of the hinge is ridiculous, there are tons of other cases just like mine, the build quality of the hinges are defective. I need to speak with someone at HP to get the laptop fixed, I spent $1000 for a defective laptop. I've never mistreated it or been rough with my laptop.

I have a HP ENVY  Product: E1P14AV Model: 17t-j100.  The left hinge was broken and the fan locked up so I took it apart and found dozens of little pieces of plastic and loose gromets inside the machine.  A gromet was lodged in the fan causing the fan problem.  The left hinge was broken loose and was so hard to operate that it is no wonder it broke loose.  To adjust the hinge I had to remove the touchscreen.  After adjusting the hinge, I cleaned out all the plastic,  secured the hinge and put everything back together. It all works well except for the touchscreen.  The computer does not seem to recognize that there is a touchscreen. In settings I get the message that ""no pen or touch input is available for this display. "" It worked fine prior to my working on the system.  Please advise what I should do to resolve this issue!  Thanks for any help!!!

Like a number of other posts I have a broken hinge on our Notebook 14-cm011na - these seems fundamentally poorly designed. This is causing the case to lift at the back right by the power button and it seems that the charging connection is also now affected. I fully understand that it is out of HP warranty (Feb 2019 purchase from John Lewis) and is also outside their warranty. However it seems pretty poor that a £600 laptop should be breaking after two years.I have tried to navigate the Support pages but they just keep sending me round in a circle, so now posting this as the only way to get in touch.Can someone from HP please get in touch to see what our options are.Thank you

I closed the top of my laptop just like any other day - and heard a crack.  I opened it and it felt like gravel was in the hinge.  Small plastic pieces and some small metal pieces fell out in my lap. [edit] The first attempt, they said I should call another number.  Nope, tried again hoping for another agent, and they said their system was down and to call back on Monday (it was Friday at 1 p.m.).  Nope, tried again hoping for another agent.  This time, got a nice guy named Anton that listened and then explained that I could return it and they would fix it - for $300-$400 (for an $800 PC)!  He said I should have purchased the extended warrantly. I am not sure how our warranty doesn't cover something that is clearly a defective part.  The PC doesn't travel, it's not been dropped. Anyone else had this experience?

Did HP fix it? I have the same exact problem and have been getting the run around. My laptop is still under warranty but HP won't fix it! They told me they don't cover accidental damage (which this is not - I have never dropped or misused my laptop. It's only 7 months old and has only ever been opened and closed normally. Never dropped or even transported anywhere!!) The hinge broke and cracked the casing simply by me closing the lid. I have had to pay out of pocket to get the repair done and am trying to get HP to reimburse me for this obvious design flaw. Did they fix yours?? If they aren't willing to stand behind their warranty and aren't making this right for people, I am looking to see if there are any others having the same problem to  try to get them to address the issue.

I purchased a brand new laptop 7 months ago and the left hinge popped as I closed the lid, cracking the top casing and separating it from the bottom. Fearing further damage, I immediately took my laptop to a local authorized repair center. Despite the laptop still being under warranty, HP refuses to fix it. The authorized repair center I took it to told me HP does not cover ""accidental damage"" or ""normal wear and tear"" but offered to contact HP to try to get authorization for the repairs since it's still under warranty. HP refused to authorize the repair. This is hardly normal wear and tear after only having the laptop for  7 months, nor did I cause this simply by opening and closing the lid! The laptop has never been mishandled, dropped, or in any way misused. After some quick research online and from what the repair shop told me, this is a common problem in HP Laptops and is an obvious design flaw. The hinges are too tight and the plastic is too weak to  hold up under the amount of stress placed on it by simply opening and closing the lid. Why are they not fixing this problem?? Now I have to pay $300 out of pocket to correct a problem that HP is aware of and ignoring.I will never purchase another HP product again if this is how they treat their customers.  I would like to be reimbursed for my repairs. A laptop that I paid $700 (now $1000 with repairs) should last much longer than 7 months!!!

I bought the laptop and in less than 6 months, the hinges got broken. I tried everything possible to fix it before the warranty expired but I got all sorts of push back from the hp support team here. I was told since the laptop was bought in Africa they cannot fix it in America. It's quite bad that a lot of people have experienced this issue with this model and I am yet to see a success story. The model is bad and the team that designed it should have questions to answer. It is really sad you buy an expensive laptop with your hard earned money and can't use it for even 6 months. Hp should do something about this because it is quite frustrating.

Hello,Having browsed the HP community I can see that my problem is a very common one so I am hopeful that HP will be able to help resolve the issue. 8 months ago (28th Nov 2018) I purchased an HP ENVY x360 from a reputable high street retailer in the UK. Everything seemed to work great and it helped my wife's business a lot. The laptop is well looked after as it is an expensive product and very valuable to us. 2 weeks ago, on opening the laptop, the casing on the screen near the rear hinge came away and made doing anything with the laptop impossible. I phoned the customer service team for the retailer who explained that it would still be under manufacturers warranty (less than a year) and we immediately took it in to be repaired. A few days later, my wife receives a text message saying that it was not covered and that we should pick up the broken laptop in a few days. While talking to the in-store customer service team, it seems that they carry out all repairs for HP but as we did not take out extra cover with the retailer (almost £10 per month!) they will not fix it. Is this something HP really endorse??! We are now stuck with a very expensive laptop which can not be used and my wife has no way to manage her online business. We have complained to the retailer but it seems that it is HP's guidelines which are preventing them from repairing a known fault on a premium product which broke during normal operation.  Is there something HP can do to help resolve this? We have recently bought a HP printer and ink which we can not use and I have spent thousands of pounds on HP ink for my work. We both currently feel very let down both by the retailer and HP. Broken Hinge

I have the same issues as many HP owners, it seems.  Poor initial construction and plastic parts have led to broken hinges on BOTH sides of the laptop.  I use this only at home, no traveling, carefully cared for.  I get crackling and snapping every time I open it, I now need to leave it open to prevent the top from completely breaking or breaking the laptop casing.  The screen is incredibly wobbly and flops forward, as well.  Of course, the laptop is now out of warranty by one month, purchased in August 2019.  I'm completely disappointed in HP for the inferior case build on this laptop.  That being said, the actual operation is fine.   Is there any recourse with HP to fix this issue as it appears to be a known issue?  It began deteriorating in July, and I didn't even consider warranty issues.  Thanks for any help.

So I have had this computer for a little over a year and a half and about 2 months ago my left hinge broke. I was out of the country studying abroad so there wasn't much I could do about it. After I got home I didnt have the time nor the money to fix it so I was just carefully opening and closing it. Well today when I opened it, the screen wouldn't light up. I really need to get it fixed fast because I am a full time college student and my classes depend on having a computer. What can I do? Oh I should say, it is not under the warranty anymore.Help please?

So the top left hinge of my laptop has come off and the top left corner on the bottom frame has broken and is stuck to the upper frame. I have attached an image of it below to make it clearer.  The hinge is dangling outside its intended location. On closer inspection, there seems to be a screw missing but I am not sure. The laptop was not dropped. As of now, I can use my laptop but the screen is too fragile and as a student who has to carry my laptop everyday to school, I am scared it might fall off any time. Please help. Thanks in advance.

I purchased my laptop 2 years ago and the hinge broke recently although I was taking really good care of the laptop and it was never dropped or hit. As my warranty expired, I thought I would be cheaper to get it fixed by a technician, however, he couldn’t find the part that needs to be replaced anywhere and he told me that the price is approximately 250-360£ for that part to be bought and get installed (if found). As a student I definitely cannot afford it and I am really disappointed as the laptop’s price was 1100£ and it basically only lasted 2 years. I read a LOT of complaints about the same issue online, as well as from my friends who got the same model after my recommendation. I emailed HP 2 times but hasn’t got any response back. Shouldn’t HP take responsibility of that problem as it is acknowledged that it’s clearly a design flaw?

I closed my laptop yesterday and noticed the screen still lit between the screen and the keyboard. I opened it again only to find that the left hand hinge had seized and pulled the mounting from behind the display. Called HP support and found that because my laptop is around a month beyond warranty, they are going to charge me $400+ for repairs. I paid almost $1,000 for this laptop 13 months ago and browsing this forum have found several people with the exact same issue.  I have had several laptops over the years and NONE of them have ever broken until now.

Broken Hinge, fortunately I saw it early and didn't break the screen.It is a bit scary to open and close it now, close to being unusable.Now the question is, how is this going to get fixed? I assume it either broke or came loose (the hinge) because it's pressing now against the screen and flexing it thus risking it break. Are there parts for this? Instructions on how ti fix it?I've seen a video for the 15"" version on youtube, can the 13"" version be fixed DIY with just the right part and instructions?If yes, can I have at least 2 sets of such hinges just to be sure I can keep fixing it if that's the case? From where?Thank you!

It seems to be  a problem with my laptop left hinge.I opened my laptop asusual and shocked to see the bolts of the Left hinge to be dropped and I was unable to open the screen fully.It started to form a gap between the dispaly screen and the backpanel steel case. When I try to close or open it the gap seems to be increasing eventually and It was visible that hinge has been broken. it was sad to see these type of things for a laptop which is expensive. I reached to near by store regarding that but No luck. They said that they will not repair this kind of things and continues to say that.l, If they do it anyhow they can't guarantee to handover me the PC as before and they suggests that to through it somewhere and buy a new one.. It is the only HP recognised service centre in my city.How a Service center guy say like that and why there is No service for this things.. He also mentions that we need to replace the whole back panel and doesn't guarantee about the touch screen after reparing..and it may cost around 15-20k Indian Rupees.... Does it cost that much just for a hinge loss which is also happened itself.I mean without any dropping or hitting it... Kindly please help me regarding this.. Suggest me what to do regarding this plzz..

The hinge on my laptop (out of warranty) is messed up. The laptop still works perfectly fine and I can use it, however the hinge prevents me from closing it or even adjusting the screen even slightly. It is really loose, and I can feel that the hinge has come apart at the back. Every time I try to adjust the screen it makes a cracking noise and becomes looser. I have found a small bit of black plastic (like, a tiny bit) which I assume has come off of it but it might not be from the laptop. It is also pulling apart the casing around the screen of the laptop. I understand that it is likely not going to be possible to fix this without paying, but is there anything I can do to fix it even slightly? It is very inconvenient as I can't bring my laptop anywhere and I have to be incredibly careful whenever moving it. Thank you in advance.

This machine pulled apart at the hinge when trying to open it. IT WAS NOT DROPPED OR OTHERWISE MISTREATED. It was fine when closed and then the next morning broke when trying to open it. The warranty expired less than a month ago. The computer has not been used for a year - less than 9 months actually. I was told it would cost $400 to have HP fix it. I called local repair places and they said this is a common issue with HP laptops - the hinges break. This seems to be a manufacturing defect and ought to be covered even if the warranty  is 3 weeks past expiration. I have checked in this support community and it seems this problem goes back several years and has yet to be addressed by HP (in terms of correcting the defect). Has anyone else had this problem and have you found a way to get HP to take care of it? My attempts to talk with someone, or otherwise get heard have been entirely thwarted: endlessly transferred between departments and eventually just cut off. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi, This seems to be a common problem with this laptop. The left hinge on my HP ENVY 360 has become faulty of it's own accord. The corner of the screen is being forced away from the housing and the pressure has caused discoloration to the screen. I bought the laptop in August of 2020 and so it is outside of warranty. I paid extra for a better screen as that is important for my work. I called HP customer service and they only cited the 1 year warranty. This is extremely disappointing as the screen has broken just outside of a year and it's due to a manufacturing error; I have been very careful to look after this laptop. I thought HP were a top of the line computer company and it feels like I've bought a cheap knockoff. If the fault was mine I wouldn't have a problem paying for the repair, but as it is due to a manufacturing error I would rather take my business to a different company instead of spending more money on a mid-range product, that is not cheap, that hasn't held up after just over a year. If HP don't care about their customers they are, quite frankly, not a company I want to be dealing with. Edit: The screen is now not staying up and just falls flat.

The bottom right portion of my HP laptop screen began popping out a while back, and now the right hinge is completely broken as well as the plastic lid/frame.  At this point, the touch screen seems to be working just fine.  Do you have replacement hinge and lid top/screen bezel parts available for repair?  I have done a screen replacement on a prior laptop, so am optimistic I can do a similar repair on this device.  I see that there was a similar ticket filed by another customer, so I am optimistic you've experienced this before and parts are available.

I have had this laptop less than 2 months purchased it off Amazon and the right hinge on the display is broken.  The screen is not damaged at all.  I have seen multiple post on this happening and I want to know if there is a way to get it repaired.  The warranty is expired (product was refurbished)  Due to the face that this is a know issue with the units any advice would be helpful.  I don't feel like I should have to pay for a repair that is a know issue with the product.

I bought this 28/10/2019 and have used it daily ever since. It has never left the house and I have been careful not to damage it in any way. All of a sudden there was a cracking noise and I am now unable to shut the case without the screen pulling away from the body. Reading this forum it seems to have been a common fault for some time - why have HP not done something about it? Prevously I had been more than happy with the machine. Before this I had a smaller HP model which was fine but because of the small memory only suitable for basic tasks so I upgraded.Supplier is not interested as it is out of warranty, we live in the country, there is no repair shop handy and I can`t do without it for any period of time so is it possible to fix it at home, bearing in mind I am not particularly tech-savvy.As mentioned I was quite happy with HP products but if this can`t be sorted I won`t be sticking with them.

Hello,  I bought an HP Envy 15t almost 4 years ago. The hinge recently became unglued from the inside. Upon opening the laptop, this led my screen to warp, causing several small cracks. Apparently, the HP Envy is prone to this issue as a consequence of being manufactured with glued hinges (instead of with hinges that are fastened with a screw). The faulty hinge has left my laptop extremely vulnerable to further damage, preventing me from using it. This is not a fun problem to have as a busy biology undergraduate. This was my first HP product and, although it has always performed well, it's quite disappointing to have a near-thousand dollar laptop fall apart not 4 years into ownership. Of course the HP warranty only lasts one year, so mine is expired. That said, I have seen several instances of HP repairing this specific issue for a discounted price, even for free in some cases, in recognition of their flawed design.  I would like to hear from anyone who has had the same issue and how HP handled the situation.  Thank you,  David

The hinge and screen have broken just 2 months after warranty. The laptop was used light and was never roughed up or had a fall. I was astonished at the many people who have faced this particular hinge problem with HP hardware for years now. I feel disappointed. As a company with such brand name, do you not have the moral responsibility to repair foc all your common recurring design flaws or atleast give a 5 year warranty for known design issues. We have 2 more HP laptops at home and 1 hp home printer. Have trusted this brand only to be let down like this.

Hi all,About a week ago when opening my laptop, the left hinge malfunctioned, causing the display screen to crack and making it impossible to close the computer. The hinge itself seems to be bent, though I have no earthly idea what caused this. This computer has been used only for schoolwork and has never been dropped or damaged in any way previously.  I'm not sure if it's possible to bend the hinge back into place, or fix the issue without having my computer serviced, but this would be ideal seeing as I use my laptop every day for school and now work.  I'm extremely displeased with this fact considering I did nothing to cause this damage, the hinge simply stopped working. Additionally, this seems to be a common problem for the Envy x360s, which is shocking considering the main draw of the computer for me was the screen's ability to rotate. Now the computer can't even close without causing more damage to the display screen.  Any advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.

I'm having an issue where my HP Envy laptop has a broken hinge, which is preventing me from closing the laptop - when it first happened I could tell closing it would damage the screen, so I have avoided closing it. This is clearly a defect in the product, and I've found a number of other HP users have experienced the exact same issue. I've been trying to contact HP about this for months, but everyone I've talked with at HP says my laptop is now out of warranty, and I would need to pay for any repairs. This is frankly ridiculous - the laptop is only a year-and-a-half old! (And was less than that when I first started trying to contact you about it.) I understand that repair of normal wear-and-tear would not be HP's responsibility, but when it's something that's due to a faulty design or defective hardware, HP needs to take responsibility for their work. I need to talk with someone who can either help me figure out how to get it fixed at HP's expense, or talk with someone who can help me file a complaint.

Hi FaithR2You have described the exact situation I have. From my experience in dealing with HP both here in the UK and the States I now believe that HP will use any excuse not to carry out hinge repairs even under warranty as in my case, the reason they give is that the damage TO the hinge is ""customer induced"" a phrase they have used many times, the history to this debacle, as I understand it is that this was brought to their attention around 2009, when class action was being talked about they agreed to carry out repairs to some of these laptops, it was not well publicised and the time allowed for claims was very short consequently many customers with this problem were unaware that they could submit a claim. Even after this the hinges continued to fail right to the present day and HP have refused to acknowledge this as a problem or to carry out repairs as they should.If you contact any helpline/forum etc they will promise to ""reach out to help"" you will be pushed from pillar to post, you will be told that your case will be escalated to the next level, you will be told ""someone will be in touch"" from my personal experience none of this will happen, my first post here I was told the mod would refer it to the right departmentand someone would be in touch - it has not happened.I also posted HP's own information for making a complaint here in the UK, the mod has edited it out with no explanation, I have also been warned by the mod that if I continue breaking the posting rules I will be banned, I asked for an explanation as to what rules exactly had I broken - no reponse, so to sum up, all of us with broken hinges are going to be quelled one way or another, I have personally accepted that HP will not help so my next move is to use Trading Standards here in the UK and to try and bring this out into the public domain further by contacting several consumer affairs programmes, again, I have no doubt this post will be edited or taken down altogether, I wish you good luck and stick at it because not to is what HP want.

I have a HP 360 which is still under warranty where they have refused to repair the broken hinge saying it was accidental damage. I note from previous comments that others have had the same issue. They are quoting£370 to have it repaired which is unfair when it appears to be a fault. i have tried complaining but was told there was no one to complain to and that if I paid for a second opinion then they may consider repairing it but not pay for the additional costs involved.Anybody had a similar problem or got any ideas of what to do next. I do expect a computer to be fit for purpose and last more than 12 months. Debbie

Others have posted here and support has reached to assist.  The issue described below appears to be common. My lightly used laptop (unfortunately a few months out of warranty)  broke unexpectedly today. The left hinge broke through the display bezel instead of opening normally.   From my examination of the damaged hinge it would appear that a fastener was ""missing"" on original assembly. The laptop was given to  me by a non-profit organization for whom I serve as their volunteer web master. I'm quite certain that it's ""not in the budget"" for this PC to be replaced so soon. For now I""m using the laptop with an external monitor. I would appreciate an option for a low cost repair.[personal information removed]

Computer tech support rant: So I treat my electronics with care. For some odd reason a crack on the touchscreen of my HP Pavilion 360 tablet/laptop combo developed recently. The thing is usable, and the crack is underneath the top layer so there is no finger injury if I touch the screen. But it needs fixed, so I filled out the online form to explain my problem for a warranty fix. I was then advised I can call to followup and do a repair option or e-mail correspond. Okay, fine. No problem. I'll call. I can do some things with the phone on speaker. One hour and 20 minutes later and three foreign call center reps that clearly weren't from the USA (one answered, one was a tech rep, and then he couldn't do the actual send in and fix situation so I went to a cost and repair rep for figuring out how to get it fixed), and I am flaming mad. First, all three repeated what I wrote and asked questions as if I am lying to them, or didn't know what I did wrong. One had the audacity to ask how I close my laptop. Yes ma'am, I slam it down as hard as I can and throw it against the wall to see what happens and make sure it turns off for the night. (I didn't say that, but may as well have.) I take care of my products. She said it would cost $270 to fix. Wait, $270? She said because it was a screen issue, it costs money. I said it is under warranty. Hardware is under warranty, not software apparently. But this isn't software, it is a HARD component of the unit. I can't just install and uninstall a touchscreen. Nor am I paying $270 plus shipping when I bought this last May for $350. If I'm paying that much to fix a screen, I may as well buy a new unit that is faster and more up to date. She said she would escalate it to a supervisor. They weren't available after 6 p.m. ET. I said I work next week, leave home at 6:30 a.m. ET and won't be home until after 6 p.m. ET. I said I have to be called after 6 p.m. ET. I can't take time during the day to discuss my PC issues because if this call took 1h20m, I don't have that time at a brand new job. So, suddenly, they can call me after 6 p.m. ET. When they do on Monday, if it is a foreigner I will demand a precise, clear-speaking English person. I'm not trying to be racist, so falsely accuse me if you wish, but when it comes to communication, and there is a thick problematic accent because English is not their native language in India or wherever they are from, that is a serious issue. If I can't understand the words coming out of their mouth without having to constantly ask to have something repeated or listen super carefully because if I don't I may miss a word that misconstrues the entire sentence, that's not good enough for me. I've been on both ends of customer service, so speaking to an English person *IS* critical, especially when the situation is bad. I want an American on this one. Either they fix it for free AND fix it on an ASAP speedy process (because quite frankly, I was insulted with how they treated me and the hold times each time to be asked the same questions and made out to be an abuser of my machine), or I am done with HP/Compaq products after 15 years of loyalty to them. I really don't even expect a call Monday from HP. I doubt anyone calls me. And for what it's worth, when my ex-wife's HP computer had a hinge break, that was hardware. I could have took pliers and broke it on purpose. But they fixed it no issue. But a screen that clearly wasn't cracked by me (trust me, I could take a hammer to it and make it a spider web crack) isn't covered and isn't hardware? What is it? Touchware a new term? If it's not hardware, I want to know what it is. And I don't care about what the warranty says, if you send out a defective product that doesn't last even eight months (if that), you need to fix it. I did not take a hammer to my screen, I did not slam my PC or throw it against something, and it is in a protective case when I travel, and it is put in a safe location when not in use. In fact, I barely use the touch screen. But yet I am made to feel it is my fault and I have to pay $270? I'd fix it myself with parts on Amazon but it requires completely dismantling the screen part from the keyboard part and it's a mess and not worth it. I'll just buy a new one somewhere and be done with it. But for a crack I didn't cause -- and if they saw it, they'd know because the crack is underneath and not something I can do on top -- and say $270? Kiss my rear. Fix it for free, or lose my business. And I don't ask for free handouts, but when I'm insulted, and when I type out my issue and am given the Spanish Inquisition each time I talk to someone, as if what I typed was a generic lie, I am deeply offended. I have better things to do with 1h20m of my time on a Saturday than to waste it with HP trying to fix their product issue. Fifteen years from my first Compaq Presario to several HP Pavilion models of desktops and laptops. Six total I've bought from Windows ME to XP to Vista to Windows 8 (and the free 10 upgrade).  Guess it's done now because HP has dropped the ball, unless they come through with a miracle.

I purchased my HP Envy x360 from Costco in July of 2018 (less than year old) and have already had two major problems with it. The first issue occured last November (2018) when my laptop completely stopped working and a black screen appeared with the ""Boot Device Not Found"" error displayed on the top of the screen. After several back and forth exchanges with HP support over the phone, I finally sent in my laptop to be repaired for free and it turns out there was a faulty system board in this brand new laptop (3 months old). During the repair process, I experienced yet another complication. I kept getting an email/text saying that the repair is taking longer than expected and that they were pushing back the expected date of repair in increments of weeks. It got to a point where the expected repair was pushed back by a whole month and as a college student with finals in mid-December, I was frustrated. I called HP support again and eventually got in contact with a escalation case manager who helped me get my lapotop back quickly as it seemed the technician team at the service center were delaying the repair process without any real excuse. This first encounter was really painful, however I gave HP the benefit of the doubt as this is my 3rd computer from them in 4 years. But the story gets better as I am experiencing an issue with the same laptop, this time the left hinge keeps popping out (see images below) when I open the lid. I have seen several folks on this community write about the same problem for the same laptop so I am not alone it seems having this potential manufacturer defect problem.  I cannot believe this was happening to me again - 2 HPs in 3 years and both having multiple issues.  My parents and brother own an Apple, Dell and Asus and they have never complained about a thing for years.  My HP on the other hand a disastrous experience to say the least.  Backing just keeps popping off everytime now.  So, I called HP support today and spoke to Anirban who told me that the only way this issue could have arose is if I personally damaged it by either dropping it or applying uncessary, external pressure.  Also, said cosmetic damages are not covered under warranty. What a bunch of hogwash when clearly the pics show no damage and the hinge has separated on a brand new laptop without any undue force.  I am thinking something happened to it during the last repair and now they are shifting the blame on me (speculative I know, but likely).  I specifically told him that I did neither of those things and that it just happened by itself one day when I flipped the case open. He kept on saying that the repair center would take a look at it if I send it in, and then I would have to pay for the damage repairs and replacement parts which is expensive. While on hold for a very long time, I did some of my own research about this issue with my laptop model since it definitley seemed like a manufacturer defect. After looking at other HP support forums and other websites, I saw that several other people have had the same issue as me where the (left) hinge breaks and the laptop backing starts to seperate from the LCD screen. There have been several cases of this and makes me wonder if the hinges or something attached to the hinge is faulty/defected, but HP will not own up to it and rather have their customers pay for the repair damages to make more money. What happened to customer experience and satisfaction (guess things of the past).  This is not right! As a customer who has already been through a faulty issue with the same laptop once, HP support should have been more helpful and supportive to fixing my issue rather than arguing with me and casting the blame that I was personally responsible for the damage. Who is training these folks?  I am really frustrated with HP and upsets me that I have run into a second issue within the first year of using this laptop. As a college student who relies heavily on a functioning laptop, HP has made it hard to trust them. After experiencing these two issues and the arguments I have continously had with the HP support staff, I would not recommend HP products to anyone. If anyone has experienced the same issue as me and got their problem resolved please let me know!

There are a numbet of posts related to this and it seems this is still an issue. The screws attaching both hinges to the display have come out because of the plastic. This laptop has been sitting at a desk for its entire use and has been barely open or closed in that timeframe.  Seems to be a serious design/quality flaw with this laptop. Who can I contact to see about getting this repaired or a replacement display assembly?

This is not a request for help but rather a message that this was solved.My  printer was printing blank pages and the left top lid cover hinge had broken. I did not realize that this opened the laser shutter until I read about it on here in another topic. So I downloaded the HP4000 service manual - google HP4000 service manual - and dismantled the printer right side and top cover. I removed all the broken pieces and located the shutter which is at the top of the black laser assembly. It is spring loaded. Suggestions I saw were to use a pencil eraser to hold it open. I thought that was a potential problem way to do it as the eraser could come dislodged and  jam somewhere. Instead I used a material called coax seal which is a malleable substance not unlike clay used to seal RF connectors. I pushed the shutter open and applied a liberal amount of the material so it could not close. I did this on both sides to be safe. I suppose the shutter could just be removed but I did not want to take a chance of damaging something doing that. In the end the printer prints fine with a new old stock 27A cartridge.  The printer has printed 36400 pages which I guess is low for its age. It is a home network printer and has worked great for years.

I have had my envy for about 15 months. I noticed the screen on the bottom right was a little weird. While taking my final for school, however, I noticed that I could not adjust my screen position because it was rubbing against the keyboard. This is when I noticed that the hinge is broken. Two screws fell out of the crevice between my screen and back of screen and plastic came with them. Now, I have only used my laptop for school purposes in the year that I've owned it. It stays in a case and gets put away when I am done using it. I have also never dropped it. I've owned other HP laptops before and never had a problem. This is the first time. I'm just kind of upset with the price I spent on this laptop and the fact that it's falling apart only a year later. I've noticed that others have had this problem also. Is there anything that I can do to fix this? I need my laptop back in commission before spring semester starts back up. I'm scared with the way that the hinge forces the screen outward that it will damage my screen next. Thank you

I had the problem that others have, with the annoying sound of the scan bar moving back and forth, not parking when not in use. I tried everything you could imagine! Then I pushed lightly down on the top of the scan bed and found the the lid is not heavy enough!

Both were treated with care.  I’ve read dozens of this same exact issue. What the hell is HP doing to take care of this? I want this fixed at no expense. What does the community think of this issue? This is not a $10 item. HP should be ashamed and accountable.

So basically, last night out of nowhere, I hear a snap and notice that one of the hinges on my laptop has broken. I’m really upset by this of course, as I’m a college student and my computer was completely fine up until this point. Anyways, I do as anyone would do and try to figure out how this could’ve happened and try to contact HP Support. So after going through forums for hours, I find out it’s a design flaw where the hinges are glued on rather than screwed so I know why it could’ve happened. However, when I try to contact HP Support, I’m getting nowhere. The online assistant says I should check my warranty, there are no visible numbers or emails to contact. So after hours of frustration, I decide to leave it for the next morning (today). What do you know, somehow HP Support is unavailable??? I didn’t even know that could happen but I’m extremely upset. I don’t have the funds to just buy a new computer on a whim and this break wasn’t even my fault, but even when I try to resolve it, I can’t do that. This is so unprofessional on HP’s part and just plain evil. My warranty only expired a month ago so I’m assuming that has something to do with it but why should that even matter when this is a regular occurrence and a design flaw. I’m just very upset and have no clue what I should do. Also, the closest HP locations seem to be corporate offices so I’m at a complete loss right now.

Hey! I bought the 2021 model of the HP Envy laptop around one year ago when I recently noticed a problem with the left hinge. When opening and closing the laptop, the case pops open a little, and when the laptop is closed the screen portion is slightly misaligned on the left side from the keyboard section. It can be fixed by pushing it into place but when opening adn closing it again the problem reoccurs.  The laptop has no other issues besides this. I've been taking good care of it since I've bought it and I'm very worried the problem will worsen. Is there a quick fix to the problem or do I need to use the warranty? Thanks.

Looks like I'm a victim of yet another hinge failure on an HP laptop. Right side hinge broke several months ago, the other one broke today. Laptop is less then 2 years old, never left the house, never dropped, nothing. Out of warranty since Dec '21. Basically have to keep the screen open and straight at all times. Incredibly disappointing. Have had other brands that lasted many years without a single issue with basic functionality. Will never buy another HP laptop. Is this fixable?

HP Notebook - 15-bw033wm - left hinge broke loose last week from the screen back panel, similar to the original poster of this thread. It is, of course, out of warranty. We thought we purchased it last year during our Black Friday shopping but perhaps it was two years ago? Regardless - due to the poor build quality this is probably the last HP consumer laptop we will ever purchase. We have purchased 3 and have seen a steady decline in the build quality and durability.  SOOOOO - it appears the hinge may be OK but it's the hinge cover that failed. Pieces of the cover broke at the back panel, and in comparing with the right side, it many help hold it all together. Is the hinge cover on this unit part of the ""structural integrity"" of the attachment of the hinge?  Also there are plenty of after market hinges available from numerous sellers, but the only silver covers (touchscreen unit) available seem to be as used pieces on eBay?  I have the detailed service manual from my wireless card upgrade project so I have all the part numbers and the instructions as best I can figure them out from this manual.

Just recently as I was using my HP ENVY x360, the left hinge broke; as I was holding it, I heard a crack and saw the screen pop out from the bottom left corner. I have made sure to treat this laptop with care each use, so this was very surprising. Given the large number of similar complaints about this issue on this forum and beyond, I am inclined to believe that this is to do with the laptop's construction and not any misuse on my part. I want to receive a repair quickly as I rely on this device daily, though my warranty has ran out ⁠— what are my options in this situation? Given the circumstances, I do not feel I should be made to pay for the repair of a mistake I did not make. Thank you for your help!

I too have had the left hinge on my HP Envy 17 TS break.  It is now to the point where the hinge is no longer operable.  The case is broken and separated by close to an inch.  It was out of warranty when it started and I could not afford a repair. I purchased the PC in June 2014 and it operates fine.  However, I must now be in the market for a new PC because of the hinge and case.  My question is ""has the hinge issue been resolved or if I get a new 17 TS Envy, is the same problem going to occur"".  I like the 17"" and like the touch screen but if this is a continued design issue, I will need to look at another type of PC. Also, it would be nice to have a discount toward a new PC due to this design flaw.

Recently I noticed a slight issue with hinges on my laptop screen, where it was making a cracking noise whenever i opened or closed it. Recently the frame started peeling off, and i cant close the screen as the back hinge would come off. Is it covered, if not, how much would it cost to fix this issue. Thank you

Hinge stated to bind when opened or closed and was pulling the case apart at  the back left corner. It was som severe that you could not plug the power supply in without pushing the case back together. This occurred mid 2020 and I have not been able to close it for fear  of breaking internal components. I did not realize  it was under warrant when this occurred  because I thought it was only 1 year and discovered it was 2 years. It ran out in early December 2020.I did  sent an email to HP describing the problem since In thought there might have been a recall, but never heard anything back.I really like my computer, but hate that it is becoming unusable because of a hardware issue.

Cannot find the correct category to put my question into. I have had my HP laptop for about 2 - 2-and-a-half-years. About six months ago a crack appeared on across the power button, however this has gradually got worse and today has become very severe. I cannot find any papers regarding warranty etc. I assume the warranty is up, but how long does it usually last? and is there any other way to fix this? thanks

Unfortunately, I also have the same problem. It happened this morning.  I always felt like this was a very poorly designed computer as I compared to my wife's Lenovo Yoga. Mine always felt like it was more fragile. I used to hear some craking noise everytime I closed/opened the screen. I almost NEVER used it in tablet mode, but I wish I had, so this problem would most likely have happened before and I could have returned it to the store.

My HP is about 3 years old and the hinge has recently broken. I took it to our local PC repair store and they said that this was something they couldn’t replace themselves, and they recommended that I contact HP directly. I’m not sure how to do this - does anyone know? Has anybody else had this problem with their HP envy? If so, how much did it cost to repair?  Thanks

Opened up the back and it looks like the screws that hold the hinge in place have just completely detached from the bottom. It happened on its own, and it also caused cracking in the back near it. Almost a 3 year old laptop so obviously no warranty but was wondering if there is a way to fix this? Worried about dumping super glue into my laptop but that's the only thing I can think of.

I know I am not the only person (far from it) with this problem -- the left hinge of my HP Envy 360 popped out and now I am unable to safely use my device without risking further damage.  I've tried contacting HP support through the chat function, but it does not work, so I'm hoping that posting here can help.  Clearly HP knows that this faulty hinge problem exists, so I would like to know what HP is willing to do to fix the problem for me - replacing the hinge or replacing the computer would be a good start.  If nothing can be done, I will turn to another company from which to purchase a new laptop.

The hinges of my 2.5-year-old HP Elitebook 8470p suddenly cracked a very loud noise as I opened the lid and now they are both broken. I heard that there was a recall period because of hinge poor design issues in 2009 but even new models of HP laptops are still suffering from these issues... Is that true?

How do I get repair for a broken hinge on my HP ENVY 17t QUAD?  It is out of warranty and I've already contacted HP a few times on the battery needing replacing and found out that you do not even have these batteries for this laptop any more.  Which i my opinion is crazy on your part.  The first couple of contacts HP referred me to for a battery replacement would not answer phone calls or emails.  So after talking to HP for a 4th time, I made sure I got several product ID's that were compatible to the current bad battery and after researching online I've purchased one from Amazon that is the product ID HP referred me to, but the V and mAh are different from what is in the laptop now which is the original.  So before I even try this new battery, I need the hinge repaired.  This laptop has been babied and never been abused which means the hinge breaking is a manufacturer error.  Now back to the original question, ""how do I get repair for a broken hinge on my HP ENVY 17t QUAD""?

Hey all! The screen/display case for my HP Envy cracked at the seam, and I wanted to ask if anyone knew what the issue is? (I checked a few threads and gathered that it might be the hinges, but I've no tech knowledge and figured it best to ask directly.) My laptop's a few years past warranty so I'm probably out of luck for free repairs; would anyone have price estimates for that as well? It's never been dropped or needed fixing before, if that helps! Thanks!  (edit: seems the pictures aren't showing up  if anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know!

Looking for advice on what to do with my 1.5 year old HP Envy 17 Inch Laptop (which cost me approx £1500).The right hinge is broken and the casing is coming away. I am worried that my laptop may soon no longer function unless I get it repaired very soon.Does anyone  have any idea if a problem like this can be successfully repaired and quickly? Also how much should I expect to pay to have it repaired....are there HP certified repair centres as I don't want to take my laptop to just anyone (lots of guys who repair PCs etc on the side but no guarantee that they won't damage my laptop for good!)Due to Covid-19, I need to use my laptop every day to work from home.With very high demand for laptops and PCs at present, it's not possible  to buy a replacement laptop at present anywhere, but then again I would rather not have to shell out £1500 again for a new laptop when my current one is still quite new. Many thanks,Emilia

The right hinge of my HP laptop has failed and now the bottom of the laptop is prying open when I open or try to close the laptop. It is getting worse and worse. This was a very expensive laptop and I have always taken good care of it so this is very suprising for me. I think the plastic hinges were not a a great design for such a heavy screen/laptop.

I have an HP Envy x360 m convertable (purchased in December 2017). I have the exact same problem that tons of other people have had: the right hinge on my notebook has broken somehow. The separating of the hinge casing threatens to separate the screen from the rest of the laptop if I don't hold the two together when I close the laptop. So far the screen remains undamaged, however, if the hinge issue isn’t immediately fixed the screen will likely separate from the black plastic casing.  There is no way this occurred due to any fault of mine, I meticulously care for my laptop and never take it anywhere. It sits on the desk in our home office and does nothing other than open and closes. It has not been moved since it was placed on the desk in December 2017. The reading numerous forums its clear several others have had the same issue. I am quite sure my warranty has expired. However, that should be of no issue in this case as this is a design flaw and should be a recall issue. I hope and feel HP should do something to fix my laptop, or to give me a different one, as I would not have bought this computer had I known how poorly built it was. I can not afford to purchase a new laptop after only a year and a half.  In looking at what damaged it appears the hinge is screwed into a very limited piece of small plastic with three very small screws. This small piece of plastic appears to have broke which is causing the hinge issue. This is certainly either a design flaw or should be a recall issue. I truly hope and pray HP will do the right thing and fix my laptop for free. There is nothing that I have done which may have caused this issue. Respectfully, Emily

I too have the same problem as everyone else. 
 
It is incredibly frustrating as it is clearly a design fault. I  bought the HP as it had good reviews and looked to be solid. I was expecting it to provide many years of solid use... and got less than 2!  I'm hoping to find a way to resolve this .. otherwise I guess it will be my last HP product. Has anyone in the UK managed to find a solution?  (even a good source of information on how to repair it myself if I have to would be helpful... from the look of it it may not be the hinges but the plastic shell that holds the screen which makes it a more challenging repair. HP really needs to own this problem as it is their doing.

Hello, Gotten the Elitebook for its flexibility to switch between tablet and laptop. Was so satisfied with it until I felt the screen was loose and upon checking found the left hinge to be out of place and possibly broken. This caught me by surprise as I hardly switched to tablet function except for a few occasions during my presentations. Have been using the laptop with extra care as it cost a bomb and it was sitting on my desk most of the time. I've been using my laptop for about two years and now this happened. Upon reading online, found that this is quite common among Elitebook/Envy owners. Such highly rated laptop selling at such premium price but this is the quality we get? I can't help but to feel tons of disappointment.

Eventually, even the extended warranties expire, and a laptop owner is on his own for repairs. Why doesn't HP make it easier for the owner to make simple repairs like replacing the battery? I had to remove 15 screws, remove the optical drive, and peel off the entire bottom of the case (not easy) just to replace the battery. Ridiculous.  HP could have made the battery removable with one button or latch without the necessity of even opening the case. Then there's the cheap rubber strips attached to the bottom by spirit gum.  The spirit gum (or whatever it is) eventually smears and makes a mess.  Is this the best HP engineers can do?

Hi!I've got an OMEN 15 (15-ek0xxx) three months ago and recently I noticed an issue with the ""R"" key.  The key is faulty, it works inconstantly (it stops working and starts suddenly), for example, while I am writing this text some words that contain ""R"" are typed correctly and sometimes it is not. When I am playing, the key stops for a longer period. I need to push it and keep pressing till it works. I've seen a few posts with the same problem (but different keys and different OMEN model) but none of them with a real solution. It doesn't seem to be a hardware issue, since the key works if I keep it pressed (without tapping many times) and according to the other posts too. What should I do??

I bought an Envy Touch laptop 15 months ago ( 3 months past warranty) The hinge is defective and cracks and splits from the bottom panel every time I open the screen. I've already sent it in to be repaired a couple months after I purchased it. But then it breaks again...and again. The product is clearly defective. Numerous other people have complained about it, as well.  HP customer service is a joke; it seems like once your warranty expires you can't reach anyone. I'm an attorney and look forward to suing HP for products liability. But in the mean time, does anyone know the best way to fix the hinge issue? is there a secret way to actually reach someone at HP? A place you can recommend I take it to be repaired?  Thanks for any help!

20 months after purchase, the left hinge is broken. HP only gives one year warranty (how convenient for them). I have never dropped the laptop or used it in any way that would be damaging. I rarely open or close it. Now, I can close it, but while opening it the left hinge does not want to turn, which makes the plastic frame start to rip off the screen and make popping noises. Searching this forum just a couple minutes shows this is an extremely common issue with several of HP's laptops. ""Left hinge broken"" gives hundreds of results. It is obvious this is a design flaw, and shows HP is unconcerned by the poor quality of their products. Real trash. I hope this will not cost a fortune. It would be insulting to pay a large sum of money just to use a laptop more than a year. What should I do to repair my product the cheapest way? Does anyone have experience of letting a third party or local laptop reparation center fix this issue?

I bought my laptop last year, and I still have a bundled warranty. My laptop hinge is slightly loose and I swear I'm always taking care of it more than myself. I'm afraid that it will be completely detached. I want to know if hp can fix it and will it be under my warranty? and if not, how much will be the repair cost? I'm a minor and my mon will kick me out of our house if she found out that my laptop is broken, Please answer me because I'm so scared. :((( I don't have anything to use for my online classses.

This forum has been updated as of Aug 2014.  This is not a troubleshooting Forum. Please refrain from asking any questions that has to do with resolving a technical or software issue with your laptop. If you need help fixing said issue, search for it in the forum home or create your own post. This is the best way to quickly have your question answered and issue resolved. Any questions regarding help for software of hardware issues will be graciously ignored.  Welcome. This is the place to get try and get the best sound from your Beats laptop. Unbelievably, people are still reading this forum, even though it was initially created years ago. Also there are people still asking and posting questions. Because of this, I’ve decided to revive this forum and add the new details for the new Beats EQ HP laptops. I also want to try and change this forum from a simple troubleshoot and Beats EQ forum, to one that discusses getting the best sound from your HP laptop. Because of this I ask everyone not only to post their particular EQ settings, but the headphones and music they use to come up with the numbers. This will help others trying to tune their own laptops with a baseline to follow. This also helps if you have Solos or Soul’s or whatever the kids wear nowadays. Since this forum has been enlarged to an all-around HP laptop music forum, all questions regarding getting the best sound from your machine will be welcome (except for troubleshooting). Now after all that, here are the new, updated EQ settings for the Beats Audio on HP laptops. *NEW* Eq settings. Bass- 50Treble- 10 (raise at your own leisure but keep low)Center- 45Space- 50Focus- 50 65hz- 6 (I like bass, so you can lower if you chose)125hz- -1250hz- -4500hz- -1 to 2 (couldn’t decide where to keep this so choose what suits you)1khz- -23khz- -36khz- -39khz- -312khz- -2 Tuning information:My laptop- HP Dv7 Envy with Windows 8.1 (purchaed in late 2012). If your laptop is newer and thus has a diffrent version of Beats, then i'm sorry but i'm not rich enough to keep up with new computers. Headphone- AKG K375 In-ears.Songs used to tune:This is Berk- John Powell (How to Train Your Dragon).Skyfall- Adele.I Need a Dollar- Aloe Blacc.Canceling the Apocalypse- Ramin DJawadi (Pacific Rim)TRON: Legacy End Titles- Daft Punk.Ilyena- Mars Volta.Team- Lorde.Neodammerung- Don Davis (The Matrix Revolutions).Aural Synapse- Deadmau5.Trap House III- Gucci Mane.True Blood- Justin Timberlake.Thriller- Michael Jackson. My goal was not to make each of these songs sound their best (That would be near impossible with this EQ). It was to find a natural and neutral balance within the EQ so that no matter what song you’re listening to, you didn’t have to change the EQ back and forth to suit that particular song. I listened to songs that spanned almost the entire spectrum, from pop to hip-hop, soundtrack to rock, and electronica to R&B to find that balance where no song had too much high, too little bass or overwhelming mid. Once again, remember that this is the EQ for my particular songs, headphones and most importantly my taste. I prefer less highs and a more prominent mid and mid bass. If this EQ setting sounds to “middy” for your liking, you now know why. Let me know is these EQ works for you or doesn’t and feel free to post your own EQ settings for others to copy and try. Older stuff i posted but still applies. Beat Audio Setting  first off, use the Beats Audio EQ, its there for a reason. to get to it, just search for HP beats audio control panel. you may want to add a shortcut on you desktop for easy access. click on equalization under speakers and headphones. now here is where your personal preference takes note, i tuned my eq to best compliment every type of music i listen to (dance, rock, hip-hop, classical, scores, and vocal) depending on what type of music you listen to, you will adjust the raise or lower the Db according to the Hz's. as a rule, the lower the Hz's, the more bass is played and the higher the Hz's, the more vocals/ highs are played. Subsequently, knowing what Hz's affect the notes in a song also helps. 31-62 Hz's are bass. 125-250 bass/mid. 500-KHz are where most vocals are heard. 12-15khz is where most notes to high to clearly hear are played.    Computer Setting. your computer has a different setting than that of beats audio, as such you may want to address it too. search for sound, click on speakers and headphones and select properties. tone should be 4 bass and 4 treble. now enhancements. they are all off and include bass boost, virtual surround, room correction, and loudness eq. in my opinion, they should all stay off. bass boost adds bass, but severely sacrifices clarity and vocals. virtual surround and room correction don't do much, and loudness eq raises and lowers volume depending on the song playing. it makes one song louder and clearer, then diminishes the next and muffles it. its very inconstant and as such should stay off. as for any questions regarding Shared and Exclusive Mode (in the advanced section of speaker and headphones property) read message 29 for answers. Itunes setting If you are like me, you use itunes to listen to music. Subsequently, it also has an eq. first, click on edit and select preferences, then playback. turn on sound enhancer, it helps slightly, and leave it in the middle. now the itunes eq can stay where it is. it does not enhance the music that much to really worry about it, but you can tweak it if you wish, just leave the markers close to 0db and adjust it by 1db or less. also be aware that itunes has a slight eq delay. Update* after using the itunes eq extensively, i just recommend you don't adjust it at all, using two eq's on your computer can lead to undesired effects and be a general headache as you have to adjust one every time you adjust the other. also itunes eq just happens to suck so don't use it when you have the Beats Audio eq instead. Infact, dont adjust any EQ settings for any media player you use; It just makes things to complicated Final Thoughts A good music setting does not necessarily make music louder. it makes it clearer, it brings out the vocals while helping all individual instruments shine, instead of clumping them together. when every instrument is heard, every vocal is prominent, bass is complimentary, and they all work together, you have achieved true music. the Beats Audio chip does enhance music as long as your willing to be patient enough to tweak it, and in my opinion, computers with the Beat Audio chip are an excellent advancement in music listening experience. also every question is sent directly to my email so i can respond in a timely manner, if you have a question, just ask. 

	Don't ask for Kudos. If you deserve it, you will receive it.

Hi everyone, I have been having issues with the right hinge of my HP Envy 17"" laptop for about 5-6 months now. I was surprised to see that this was happening as I have NEVER dropped my $1000+ laptop. For the past two years, my laptop has more or less sat on top of my desk. This seems to be an ongoing issue among other HP Envy users. A few examples are linked below.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Hinge-Issues-Has-HP-ac...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-17T-laptop-hinge-desig...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-17-Hinge-Issues/td-p/6... Since the hinge has been coming off and being popped back into place, the system fan has been suffering. I now receive a System Fan 90B danger code when I start up my computer. This issue has been ongoing for about a month now.  I tried calling HP (+1 800 474-6836) but they did not help with my situation. They said my laptop was out of warranty and that they could repair my laptop for $400+ (including tax + shipping). Being a school teacher, I really have no such funds to be spending on a laptop that I was hoping would stay intact for much longer than this. It is disheartening to think that this is a huge problem with HP Envy laptops. I called my local uBreakiFix and they mentioned that other people have had the same issues with their HP Envy and they could not help. Their services could not be offered because they cannot outsource/find the backplate to repair the hinge.

I am having the same problem.  My warranty has expired and the hinge on my laptop has broken.  Also this is the *second* laptop I have purchased from HP to have this exact problem.  I replaced my former HP laptop with this one ( I still have this laptop, and now the same thing has happened with the replacement.  I am extremely disappointed.  I work from home and I have worked from home for the past four years. I have not abused this laptop and I purchased it because of the specs and I wanted it to last many years. I cannot mail this out for repair because I rely on this laptop to work on a daily basis and it contains client information. Is there a way for me to take this to a repair shop and have HP cover the cost?  I am being told that because this is a design defect, HP must repair this.

Hi Community, One fine morning, I found my laptop hinge broken and as a result that broke my LED display as well. Now since having crack, I am no longer able to use touch-screen. I would like to know that from where I can get display along with complete casing of said laptop which contains hinges etc. Will appreciate if someone help me to get the part # and to share details of official HP supplier to get these parts. Kind Regards,Faizan

I need help locating an office or department to file a formal complaint with HP.  I purchased a HP Laptop 17z touch optional in September of 2017.  Today when I attempted to close the top of the computer I heard a crunching noise and immediately determined that the left hinge on the computer was broken.  I called technical support and was told my computer warrenty expired 11 days ago (coincidental?).  Suspecting  this already I asked if there was any way HP would pick up the cost of repair since I was 11 days outside of the warrenty.  I couldn't image HP not standing by a product that is only a year old, regardless if it is outside the warrenty.  There is no way my hinge on my computer should be broken after a year of use.  Either I have a lemon or HP is building it computers with cheap substandard components.  I was told my the HP technical rep there was nothing they could do.  I then asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervior was more helpful and sent me to the out-of-warrenty department.  I explained my issue again.  The out-of-warrenty department said there was nothing they could do and suggested I go to one of their authorized store, have it fixed and before paying for the service, call HP and extend my warrenty.  I just simply get over that I have to pay to fix a computer that is only a year old, especially when I did nothing, other then opening and closing the computer to cause the damage. Does any know the process for filing an offical complaint with HP?   I will be filing complaints with the Better Business Burearu and my state's Consumer Protection Agency.

My wife has an HP Envy X360 that has been great until last night.  The left hinge broke when she opened it.  The screen is popped out slightly in the lower left corner.  She has always been the most careful user so definitely no abuse in opening the lid.  She rarely if ever opened it all the way up to the convertible position.  Needless to say she is very disappointed and questioning how to take care of this.  This computer is 2 years old so has no warranty.  I searched up broken hinge and am amazed at the number of issues that there are.  I just recommended this model to my sons fiance but not sure if this is a good choice after reading the number of broken hinge issues.  I am on this site as I am trying to contact HP to determine what to do and I don't see a good way to contact them without going onto this forum and broadcasting this issue.  From what I am reading this appears to be a design issue with these models.  Please advise if there is a way to get this fixed or if HP is now taking care of this issue that seems way too common. This unit is currently working but I dont dare move the lid for fear the screen will break

As I’ve read countless other posts that had the same exact issue, I will include mine. I don’t travel with my laptop, so it doesn’t get opened and closed very often at all. And I’ve never flipped it completely around to activate “tablet mode”.  It stays open most of the time sitting peacefully on my laptop cart. My mother‘s Dell laptop is old and failing, so I brought mine to her house to allow her to borrow it for a time. She does close the laptop when she’s done using it, but it doesn’t leave her tabletop. She hadn’t even had a week, and she called me crying that it had broken and she felt horrible. She does not know what she could’ve done to break it. Sure enough, after driving to her house and inspecting it, the left hinge has completely snapped away. It has only three small screws that hold it in place to very thin plastic. Of course, the unit is out of warranty, so I’m sure HP will not do anything except offer to sell me a new one. There is not a scratch on the unit, it looks brand new like it just came out of the box. I take very good care of my things, as I get it from my mother, and she is gentle and meticulous.  This was an expensive laptop… I purchase expensive things on purpose so that they will (hopefully) last. I actually still have my very first laptop I ever purchased, which is an HP bought 22 years ago. It is still in mint condition with Windows XP.  I tried to call HP, but the only option you are given for an out of warranty unit is to purchase support time to talk to someone. I see there had been a recall for this issue, but only within a six month timeframe??? And it appears owners were NOT notified. I’ve had my product registered since I purchased it, and I received no such indication of a recall on my unit, either through the installed HP support/update software or otherwise. Had I seen a notification, I would’ve acted on it (just like I do on my vehicles). I believe, after being a 25 year HP veteran,  I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement, as this does not seem repairable. I’m also worried for my sister’s laptop, as, per my suggestion, she bought he very same one!! Very sad, HP.

Hello, I have common problem with my laptop, my right hinge broken and it caused damage on my upper cover. I'm able to fix it on my own, but I can't find specific upper cover for my laptop. On the Internet i only found pretty much the same, but it's not. Slot for hard drive is in place where my battery should go. Do You guys have any idea where I can get proper parts? My product number is Z3B69EA#AKD.Sorry for my poor English. Have a nice day P.S. I run out of my warranty

I am so so disappointed by this laptop hardware. It is less than 2 years old. It came with 1 year warranty and I took insurance for 3 year total....I had to pay extra 150 usdSo before the end of first year, I started hearing noise when I opened and close the monitor lid. It was getting worse and worse. So after a while the monitor hinge just broke off....It was over 1 year but monitor still had insurance. No warranty anymore.I had to pay 150 usd for insurance though to repair it.....they replaced the right hinge. I got the laptop back 2 months ago approx. They say something was wrong with a hinge, it was too tight or something. When they put the monitor back in, they put in the new monitor cause everything broke inside.... after that I  saw all the light at the adge of the monitor...just another dissapointment.  THe monitor bled.... Before it had no light bleed......but now it has it......But the worse thing is that it started to make noise again.....it means the hinge is again broken or will be broken any time.....I CANT TELL ENOUGH how disappointed I am by the HP omen hardware...... It is ridiculous what a bad quality of the hardware is in this laptop. How could they not test the hinges before???I mean the hinge with metal attachment are screwed into thin layer of monitor plastic.....how will this hold for few years..... I am disgusted by HP company......I paid for insurance first 150 USD extra when I bought laptop new, cause only HP offers 1-year warranty....other companies offer 2 years warranty......I thought I will not need to repair it at all.... And then I had to pay 150 USD to repair it......I spend now already 300 USD......And the hinge is making the same noise as before, it will break any time.....I will spend 450 USD on this horribly constructed laptop...... HP are you disrespecting customers on purpose. You do not care at all? Do you think we are millionaires or something How can you put such a laptop on the market with such big problems? I mean I am afraid to close the lid now cause I know the hinge will break anytime soon now.... I hope somebody repairs my laptop for free...this is injustice......this is horrible.......horrid...

We've sent a support email to HP about this, but I'm hoping someone here might have some insight as well. My HP Pavilion dv9700 laptop died suddenly while I was using it, and I have been unable to get it to power on since. I've tried everything I can think of to bring it back to life. Any ideas what might be the cause of the problem?With the battery seated, whether or not the laptop is connected to AC power, pressing the power button causes the Battery LED (lightning bolt) to blink 3 times, and then nothing. Pressing either of the QuickPlay buttons (which would normally power it up) causes the same 3-blink result.If the laptop is connected to AC power, the ring around the power connector lights up. This is the only other response the machine shows to any action.I've tried a Hard Reset (removing AC and battery, then holding the power button for 30+ seconds), unfortunately nothing changed. I've also reseated the hard drives and memory modules, and tried booting with each of the memory modules alone, in turn. No change.Thinking the problem might be a faulty power adapter (as reported by another dv9700 owner with this problem), I purchased a brand new ""HP NOTEBOOK 90W SMART AC ADAPTER"" (p/n KG298AA#ABA) and tried using it to power the laptop. No change, still the same 3-blink response when I attempt to turn it on.When I remove the battery completely and attempt to turn the laptop on (connected to AC power), nothing happens at all -- not even the 3-blink response from the Battery LED. But, considering the LED in question *IS* the Battery LED, it doesn't seem like I can draw very many conclusions from that.Any suggestions? Has anyone else seen this problem caused by something OTHER than a bad power supply? Any thoughts at all would be greatly appreciated, I'm in a real jam not being able to use this machine!The specifics on my dv9700 are:p/n: KL086AVs/n: <text removed for privacy>Thanks for your attention! Message Edited by WendyM on  11-19-2009 06:48 AM

My laptop hinge has recently started to come apart which surprising considering I haven't done anything to cause this issue. Furthermore my laptop is often connected to a desktop screen so I wonder how the hinge could have been damaged so easily.

Hi everyone. The left hinge on my HP laptop has broken in a very weird way. As you can see the broken hinge is pushing up against the screen and when I try moving the screen I can see pressure marks being applied from inside the screen. Do you guys know if hp has to fix this for me or not? The laptop is out of warranty unfortunately. I'd try replacing the hinge myself but since it's pushing against the screen I'm scared of doing any work on it.

Hello, I have an HP Pavilion - 15-au111na - laptop which is just over 12 months old (so out of warranty). Although not mis-treated, screws have been dropping out of the case, and this has caused it fo flex and break the bezel around the screen hinge.  I've attached some photos.   I have tried replacing the missing screws, but the case still flexes - I assume due the crack in the bezel. Please can you advise the best way to get this repaired? I'm in the UK. Thank you.

To Whom It May Concern:   My laptop has for some time exhibited detachment, between the bottom cover, and the base, at the left hinge seam.  It also makes strange clicking/groaning noises when opening or closing the screen/lid. From my very light research into this issue, it appears that this is a widespread manufacturer's defect with this laptop model, affecting thousands of HP laptop users.  As I have spent over $1000 on this laptop, purchased new, I have always been extremely careful with it.  It has never been dropped or bumped, and never leaves my home.  It certainly is a manufacturer's defect, from a bad engineering design of a hinge, that is tearing the laptop apart.    I do realize that my laptop is out of warranty, but this goes over-and-above warranty issues, when it is a manufacturer's defect, proven by the vast complaints that can be found online.  Unfortunately, I don't have the money for another laptop, and am afraid the laptop will fall completely apart, creating more issues, like the screen falling off.  The laptop seems to be overheating a bit, due to the proximity of the hinge and the fan.  Also, plastic parts seem to have aready broken off, and are rattling around the case.   I am very disappointed. Could you please offer a solution to this issue? Thanks,  Sean

This is another hinge complaint. The hinges have tightened up so much that when I opened up the cover, the top cover nets and screws broke off its foundation, sending broken pieces of plastic and metal nuts all over the table. The benzel warped as the top pulled away from the hinges. What is wrong with this product?  I WOULD SAY THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  Looks like this is a common problem with this laptop, as I read complaints from others.  My laptop has never been dropped, abused and does not even have a scratch on it.  The hinges are now so tight, that they will not even close. Instead of closing, it pulled all the screws and nuts out of it's plastic foundation. I took the laptop apart, removed the hinges and discovered that I cannot rotate either hinge.

So this laptop is 1yr  and 4Months old.. and a few months after end of warranty, it's starting to fall apart.It looks like the hinge broke inside. In turn this lets the hinge block as a whole rotate when opening the lid instead of the hinge doing its work. Result is that said block is breaking open the main body at each lid operation.There's various bit of plastic (screw holes, securing clips) that are exiting thru the laptop openings (usb ports, optical bay).Not sure if fully a consequence of the hinge problem, or if overall the plastic used for this laptop ages VERY badly and breaks (and this would include parts of the hinge block, as metal seems scarce overall in this model).And of course, this laptop has led a sedentary life, no fall, brutal opening etc. I've owner dozens of laptop in my life (i'm an IT worker), i have NEVER seen such a poor build quality and robustness. Is there any acknowledged issue with that model ? Any repair option ? Thanks,FPU

Hi, i have had this laptop for quite a while now and is well out of warranty but my hinge is now at the point where i have to very gently close it for fear of breaking the screen off. it is mainly the right hinge but the left is showing signs of this also. could you please advise what you or indeed i can do about this as this was obviously a design fault that was never really acted on. Regards Gerald

Has anyone else been having problems with the hinges falling apart on the HP 11 G8 EE? We got about 30 or so of this that the hinges are being destroyed. Some from a shortfall or just opening and closing too many times. The plastic that holds the screws for the hinge is very weak and breaks off. I am seeing more and more of this when replacing broken screens I see a few screws on one or both sides of the hinge broke off. Maybe this is a manufacturing problem and something is wrong with the hinges as they are not holding up after a year and a half. We have had no problems with this on the HP 11a G6 EE. So far if I can get away with it I have been using super glue to hold the hinge in place.

A: the part (the output tray extension and EndStop)  IS replaceable.
B: How to replace it
C: How much it will cost
 And can I order it. 
 
I don't know why a piece that can break off easily.. is not listed as a part to be available to be replaced.  I'm not buying a whole new printer just for that.

Model: HP Pavilion m6-1045dxOS: Windows 7 So a couple of days ago my camera suddenly doesn't work. I suspect it's because of a recent windows update (it said it set up the spca2082 camera and a usb camera). My camera, which used to show as TrueVision HD on both Youcam and Skype, is now showing as spca2082, and all I get is a black loading screen. I've tried system restore, but because the update is automatic, me setting it as choosing which updates to allow hasn't been possible (unless someone can tell me if it is).  The closest I could find to a solution in this forum was this, but I thought I'd ask anyway in case the answer is different since I have a different model. As you can see, I'm not super tech-savvy.  Any help would be appreciated, please.

Hi,Like many other complaints I have seen on here I have an issue with my HP laptop whereby the hinges have broken and the screen has started coming apart from the laptop.I bought my laptop in 2019 and used it for the 2 yrs for university and studying. I have not dropped it or damaged it physically, I took good care of it however through everyday use, the screen and the hinges have slowly started to stop working. The screen is now half detached from the laptop and the hinges no longer secure the screen or the rest of the laptop. (see photos)I am concerned that I have only owned the laptop for three years and only used it properly for two years and it has already broken with repairs estimated to cost almost as much as I paid for the laptop originally. I don't feel this is an adequate amount of time for the laptop to last, given the price I paid for it. This feels like a design fault rather than specific to the laptop and I would be interested to hear from HP about this.

Hello, I purchased the HP Omen around 2 years ago. The notebook has been fine, up until recently (a few weeks ago.) I noticed that the hinge that connects the screen wobbles, opens when closed by a quarter inch or so, and is extremely unstable. For the price of this notebook, I have no other way to put it; this is horse **bleep**. My warrante has expired (of course) and i'd like to know how to go about fixing this ridiculous issue, that has no reason to exist.

HP's community is l ittered with complaints regarding broken hinges on their lap tops.  This has been a problem for years and yet they seem to refuse to make design changes to make them stronger.  When I inquired regarding a warranty repair they seemed to use the opportunity to sell me waht they called a three year warranty, which also included my current warranty period, so actually a 2 year warranty.  I bit the bullet and sent it in for repair,  and it took 5 more days than promised.  That is inconvenient but not unforgivable,  What is unforgiveable is it was returned without my back-lit keyboard.  How does that happen?  You just lose it on the counter?  Now here we go again.....probably another 2 weeks without my computer and no compensation from HP !

The left hinge has broken on my HP 15-bs158sa laptop, despite it being well looked after and not dropped.  Now the edge of the plastic case around the screen is being forced open by the hinge when opening or closing the screen.  This enables me to see the hinge itself, which looks to be very weak - it appears as if it has broken owing to metal fatigue as the metal is incredibly thin and probably overstressed every time the screen is opened or closed.  I'm quite disappointed as it's not what I would expect from HP.  Is there a known design defect with this model of laptop?   I need to understand if it is possible to get the hinge replaced or repaired.

Hi, I'd bought my HP Pavilion 15 gaming laptop around March last year, and am disappointed to report that the hinge has broken despite lack of any manhandling. It seems that many people have this issue, and since I have unfortunately run out of warranty, I can't just send it back.Please advice.

The ""A"" key on my Omen X 17t laptop now no longer provides any input to the computer.  The other keys work fine, so I do not think that this is a software problem.  The key itself does not appear to be stuck; it depresses to the same extent that other keys do, snaps back, and makes the same clicking noise.  However, when pressed the computer does not register that the key has been pressed. It's worth noting that at first the key would work unreliably.  That is, in the hour before this happened it would occasionally not register a key press and then work fine for several presses after that.  Then it stopped working completely. I have tried clearing any debris from around or under the key, and there doesn't seem to be anything major there (though of course there's probably some dust and stray hairs/eyelashes, etc. as you usually get with a keyboard).  I haven't removed the key because I am worried about breaking the key and not being able to put it back on the keyboard (this happened to me with a previous laptop).  Is there anything which could be causing this other than something physically jamming the key?  And if it is something under the key which I need to remove by removing the key, are there are any guides or tips for how I can do that without damaging the keyboard?

Less than a year after receiving this laptop as a gift from my husband so that I could finish school, I open it one day and hear a crack.

Hello - My HP ENVY m7 Notebook is still under warranty. The left hinge has been bulging for months, getting worse and worse, until finally, the display has cracked. The touch display started exibiting problems before the display cracked. It would self-select randomly in a virtical line on that side of the display. I now suspect the faulty hinge was putting pressure on the display causing the issue. SInce I am still under warranty, a couple of months ago, before the display cracked,  I reported this along with battery issues. I could not send the computer in for repair as it is my sole work computer. I paid for someone to come out and fix the battery, but the home visit would not work on the faulty hinge and problems it was causing the display. Now - the display has cracked because of this issue, which I did not expect would happen. I am told this is not covered under the warranty, of which I still have about 40 days of coverage. They want me to send it in for paid repair. This does not seem right to me, as I believe the issue is due to the faulty hinge. Is there any form of appeal to get repair of this honered by the warrany? I have a video I took before the screen cracked demonstrating how the touch display would self select along a vertical line. Thanks -Gabriel

I bought an HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx. Last time I realised that the back screen cover lid is broken on one side and the LCD bezel also came off next to the hinge. I have used only on a desk my laptop and just happened this because of normal closing. Other than this is in like new condition. I was thinking to extend the warranty by a HP care pack but I do not know if the repair is covered by it. It needs to change back screen cover lid.This laptop have never been damaged or used improperly. There's not a single scratch or dent on laptop. Even after just regular usage I also noticed after searching on internet that this is a very common problem and many customers have faced similar issues   with the hinge. So this clearly is a manufacturing problem.I am very disappointed about this could happen with an HP laptop of this age.

I have an HP envy 17 that had the broken hinge. I took the laptop apart and epoxied the hinge and it worked beautifully. I have it all back together but am missing the screw and metal retainer that is under the rubber foot on the left hinge. Is there anywhere I can get theses missing pieces or is there a simple way to put another type of screw in the hole I'm afraid without this screw as support it will weaken the spring again. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Getzie

My Envy x360 is one month out of the one year warranty, has not been abused but now has what I see as the all-to-common broken left hinge. This is rendering the laptop almost unusable and is sure to permanently damage the screen if I continue to open or close it.  As this is an extremely well documented issue, resulting from an obvious design flaw, what is HP doing about it??

Hi, all of a sudden when I tried to close the display of my laptop (HP Pavilion - 15-cs3019nl), it did not close but rather the display hinges cracked detaching also the display bezel. I need a help. I have to repair it! It has only a year of life. It has never fell down, nothing. It is standing on a fan support since last February. I have never moved it from here. The only thing I was used was to close the turn down the display when I was not using my laptop and that is all. One day, it decided that the hinges had to break up. Hence, I need a help in finding the replacement parts: display hinges; display bezel and top cover (blue). I have searched everywhere. Thank you in advance for your suggestions/help.

I have had my HP 17-bs0xx laptop for four years. I mainly use it at my desk at my home office, and I would typically open it in the morning to start my workday and close the display at the end of the day. About three months ago the left display hinge was resistant to opening and when I got it to open there was a popping sound. Now I cannot close my laptop; the display is stuck open at an inconvenient 90° angle.  My warranty has expired. Is there any support that can be offered me in this situation?

I  am having exactly the same problem with a Pavilion I7 bought in 2019. Incredible timing for breaking down, I guess it must have been verified. Obviously the warranty has expired, and phone support denies any claim. There is no justification for an evident design flaw of the product(s), as one can see from the number of posts lamenting the same problem in every part of the world - i'm writing from Italy. HP must  (should) assume responsability for the problem. Anyone there?

While I was opening my laptop, the screen popped out from the shell it was being held in. I'm not sure how, but all three screws holding the screen to the plate at the back broke off. The hinge was abruptly broken so I quickly shut the laptop down. I know I am out of warranty but is there any way to fix this for a fee. Right now I'm worried that the entire back of the screen will have to be replaced.

Hi i have the same issue with my laptop, left hinge broken, case seperating and plastic pieces ending up in the cooling fan which causes it to overheat and stop working.
 
Who is HP is reading this and taking action its a very common fault.
The sign of a good company where customers will show loyalty time and time again is when the company acknowledges there is a problem, fixes it at nil cost and then in future designs overcomes the problem
 
Car companies do product recalls why not HP with laptops.
 
I would love HP to show to their loyal customer base that they are customer centric at heart and solve this issue

The aggravating thing about this is that I had a Care Pack that had just expired on 8/15 which I feel sure would have covered at least the fan replacement if not the required parts for the hinge. If anything is being done about this issue, please let me know

The left hinge on the laptop (HP Envy x360) that we bought our daughter for Christmas 2017 (1 yr 6mos old) suddenly it's acting up.  It doesn't look broken but she said one day she opened it and it started making clicking sound and noticed the left bottom of the screen was ""un-sticking"" as she was trying to close laptop.  I also noticed that the gap that is in between the monitor and the bottom portion of the laptop is more narrower on the left side than it is on the right side.   She currently has to open it and close carefully to prevent that from happening.  She's not able to use it as a tablet as she's afraid left hinge will become undone and laptop will separate.  She's needs to be able to use this as a tablet as she's into graphic design/animation and drawing is something needed for these fields.  She has taken good care of the laptop, most of the time she has it seating on her desk, and if she carries it to school she puts it in a padded laptop sleeve.  After researching on this community I see that left hinges breaking on very similar HP products is a common issue.  I would appreciate if someone from HP would contact me to offer a solution.

I've always been a fan of HP and have bought the HP ENVY X360 13-AY0122AU. It's still under warranty until December 2022. I rarely bring my laptop out, I've never dropped it, there is no dent or scratches and out of a sudden, it just cracked when I tried to close my laptop one day. I've contacted HP Customer Support and they said that it's not a known issue and that it won't be covered under the warranty (even though there are 6months left). From all the posts from google, it's pretty obvious that this is a manufacturing design flaw in this model series.  It costs RM1,500 (40% of the laptop's cost for the repair).. will definitely be considering bringing this up to KDPNHEP, if the warranty is not covered. The laptop is so expensive and it's such a sad experience after having to use it just for 1.5 years.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: HP has agreed to change the hinges under warranty.Thanks

The left hinge has become detached/broken on the monitor side (HP Envy x360 Convert 15-bp100na). This in turn cause the bottom monitor frame to pop out.  Over past few weeks it got significantly worse as I am unable to close the laptop to prevent from any further damage. The screen works perfectly fine and there are no cracks there.Originally it came as a surprise because the laptop was kept in a good condition, no drops or bumps with very minimal use. However, after doing some research, it seems that this issue is rather common issue, suggesting that this is a manufacturing defect.  Could you please inform me if there was any system in place to resolve and if so, what further actions can be taken? Many thanks!

Hi,I would like to enquire about the best process for getting a spare key for my laptop as one of them was snapped off in such a way that the plastic clip mechanism that secures the key is no longer functional (aka forcefully). Specifically, the ""comma"" key is the one that has broken (the key to the right of ""m"" on a UK layout keyboard).The spare part number in the parts manual for the keyboard (L19542-031) appears to cover the entire front cover of the device. Naturally I would like to avoid replacing the entire part, but after spending alot of time traversing eBay and spare parts sites (namely laptopkey.com and laptopkey.eu), I've not found anything I can be 100% certain will fit.Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks,Alex.

						I closed my laptop's panel and heard a crack sound. I then checked the hinges it was worn off and the panel behind the screen was also tearing out. I use a HP Pavilion Gaming 15 - cx0009ne bought in UAE on August 25th, 2018. It also has other issues regarding the software (I tried reset thrice but that did not make it any better). Also, when I move the laptop from the hinge (this problem started last year and I still cannot figure out what the issue is) it gets hanged and no keys work at all. I always hold power button and restart my laptop and I have done it quite a many times. Lastly, it does not download the apps I had previously installed (before resetting it thrice) in windows store. The error I get is - 0x80070005 <-- To fix this I tried running sfc and chkdsk and I restarted my laptop, also restarted bits service and tried troubleshoot but I got no success. Something is really wrong with this laptop.

I'm a reseller and one of my customers has a HP 17-ak026nb laptop that is just over a year old and the left hinge all of a sudden started to push open the screen casing (If found a lot of pictures of the same on forum on the net). I brought the device to my supplier who told me that it does not apply for repair under waranty because the hinge is broken. Repair would cost around 300,-€ which is about 2/3 the price my customer payed for the device. Which is a no go for them (and I can only agree).I've had my fair share of issues with HP devices, because of all of these issues I was already reluctant to sell or recommend HP devices. But this one really tops it all and I won't be selling and recommending any HP devices anymore.

However, the laptop has this issue for couple of months and I tried to fix this issue with hp help service before any serious damage occur. Unfortunately, the damage that I expected occurred and I am scared for any further issues to happen. Back to the help service, they did not help me at all and they literally left my case opened. My device is still under warranty and it will well end soon . I never expected Hp will have this treatment with there customers. My case was opened since 4 months and still no reply.

As the OP of the aforementioned post had their hinge repaired, I believe that others including me who have the same issue should also be able to have our hinges replaced.

my laptop hinge brass insert holders have broken and also have caused cracks in the plastic cover. i got my laptop over 2 years ago and the warranty has ended but the fault started months before my warranty ended but because of the virus I didn't get in contact with them. i have read another few community question about laptop hinges and from the internet and have realised hp have horrible hinges on their laptops(maybe horrible is abit extreme but i feel like it is). one day i opened my laptop and heard cracking and (im not sure how long after maybe a few days or over a week) later on some plastic pieces came out and there was noise when i picked the laptop up(which was the plastic peices from the hinges which i later discovered). i need help with hp as there product is faulty and the place i bought it from is confusing with their customer service over the phone. i think its a manufacturer fault. this problem has caused abit of problems for me and my family ,as we all use it for school and work. please hp help me!

Anyone else had a broken hinge but their laptop working fine? Woke up this morning to a 13 month old laptop with its right hinge bursting out of no where , and now the screen is hanging on by just one of them. Really disappointed as warranty ran out the end of Jan , and I didnt think i would need any sort of repair so soon.Not to mention the battery life is shocking and doesnt get me through a full day of normal use (taking notes)

My HP Envy laptop is less than two years old and recently, moving the screen from tablet mode the left hinge broke. The damage from the hinge spread to the screen. I took the laptop into best buy where they quoted me a price for fixing the hinge and the screen. For the price of fixing it I could just buy a whole new laptop. I invested my money in this laptop because I trusted HP and their laptops, but now looking into it I see that numerous people have had the same issue with the faulty hinge. My laptop being over a year old is out of warranty, but seeing the same issue pop up again and again for this particular laptop, I can't help but think that HP is in some way responsible for selling a falulty product. Can HP repair my laptop or help in anyway? At the very least I sincerely suggest you consider recalling this model of the HP Envy and revise the construction of the hinges. I did not mistreat my laptop and having spent so much on it, being in this situation is devastating. I hope for the sake of HP and its customers, they consider this issue.

Hello. I opened my HP Envy x360 laptop this morning and heard a popping sound. It looks like one of the hinges is popping out. The laptop works fine but it's not something that can be popped in (I tried). When closing my laptop, the hinge opens up a little and you can see into the inside, which is worrisome. With the way it opens now, I have to hold it together so it doesn't stretch apart while I open it.  I think the warranty is up so how do i go about getting this fixed?

Hi,I purchased my HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx in June 2019. Like many people have experienced in this thread, my laptop hinge has broken on one side and the laptop bezel/frame is popping off and causing issues. There are small parts breaking off the back and the frame has cracked. I have attached photos of this damage, it makes a cracking sound when I move the screen and seems to get worse with movement. This seems to be a common issue. Could I be advised on what to do please?Thanks.

The hinge appears to have broken due to normal usage (and pretty light usage at that).It clearly needs to be repaired and is still in warranty. How do I go about getting it fixed and can you confirm the warranty will cover the fix .  The broken hinge is clearly a design fault with the laptop hinge and it appears others have had the same issue.Thanks

HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15-ee0xx  Issue; Temperamental Connection between keyboard to screen/ Screen Break when opening Laptop/ Trouble with a HP Retailer/ Warranty Query Hello, I am in desperate need of advice and assistance. UK Based but due to pandemic I cannot get through to anyone! If you have a contact for the UK I would happily sort there rather than on this forum but I have no other option available at present. Apologies for the length - I needed to add in some context. I bought a HP Envy 360 in August 2020 with the aims of building up my portfolio. Working on a computer as a day job I didn't want to sit on my laptop in the evenings so I didn't get a chance to really use the laptop until the Christmas holiday when I had some time off work. Having owned the same Apple laptop since 2009 I found the mouse track pad on the Envy to be over sensitive and sometimes temperamental/ feeling a little uncalibrated, but put that down to getting used to a new interface....  28th December 2020 (laptop just over 4 months old) and I opened the screen and heard a small break as I lifted the lid. A break spanning about 3 inches max had appeared just above the right hinge. Having used the laptop for a total of around 16 hours at this point and it living practically in the box/ on my desk until the Christmas holidays I cannot say this was due to overuse. The touch screen no longer worked to the right of the break, rendering a third of the touch screen unusable, and that evening I couldn't use the keyboard at all - would not register my fingerprint, type my password and last resort the power button didn't work. Following the advice from HP online help page, as I had bought the laptop from PC World/ Curries, I spoke to a customer service advisor from there. I was under the impression that the fault was hinge related causing pressure on the screen as I had been experiencing oversensitivity on the trackpad/ mousepad prior. I stressed that the laptop was temperamental/ felt uncalibrated, but usable for the time being, but as I was within warranty I may as well get it fixed. 2 weeks later I was faced with a bill of £280 as the KnowHow Team had taken one look at the laptop and determined accidental damage due to the crack. I had asked another customer service advisor if the keyboard connectivity had been tested and they said that they could see the crack and determined this was the only cause of the problem. My laptop was returned to me and the crack had since grown to 16 inches in their care with it now not 'fit for purpose'. PC World/ Curries team have asked me to either contact HP as the manufacturer (which is deflecting responsibility) or ask an independent computer repair shop to evaluate the cause - the latter I am sure would invalidate my warranty all together. I need a resolution. I have searched through this forum and can see countless other reports of the screen cracking in the same place (by the hinge) through no fault of the owner. Had it not been for the pandemic I would have taken my laptop into store and maybe resolved the issue, but I am left with an expensive paperweight with the workability of an upset toddler. The laptop can, on occasion work, but when it does it has very limited use. I have stopped using it to prevent further problems. I know I have 7 months left under warranty with HP and have seen the HP limitations when it comes to breakages. Apart from the break in the screen, there is no damage at all to the interior exterior of the laptop. For having only owned this laptop for just over 5 months I do not think that is a reasonable amount of time to break under regular use, never mind minimal use. I have no intention of treating this otherwise beautiful laptop as gold for it was bought as an investment in my future. Please help me with this issue as I have lost total confidence in PC World/ Curries and am swiftly loosing confidence in HP which I thought was a reliable and sturdy brand.  I hope to hear from someone on the matter. I will also be in contact with PC World/ Curries, but as they have asked me to contact HP as my next port of call, I must check all boxes. I can provide photos, proof of purchase and contact details upon request. Kind regards,Georgia

My Pavilion x360 convertible 14-cd0xxx laptop screen is developing cracks on the screen due to a broken hinge. The bottom left corner is also staring to pop out. Could you recommend a repairer in Canberra, Australia? I'd imagine the entire screen and hinge will need to be replaced?

I bought pavallion 14 ce1001tx 9 months back, so I still have 3 months of warranty and 2 years of extended warrarnty. About 15 days back, my laptop had issue with the hinge,its lid wasn't opening and closing properly. I was going to contact hp but a day later I noticed the covering around screen from  bottom right corner is also coming off because of damage due to malfunctioning hinge. I contacted hp customer care and also went to service center where they told me that  it won't be covered  under warranty and sent me a quotation of INR 12000.They also told me that if it was just the hinge , it would have been covered in warranty but now because screen protection is damaged ( which is because of hinge), it will not be covered under warranty. This laptop have never been damaged or used improperly. There's not a single scratch or dent on laptpp. Even after just regular usage for college purpose for 9 months, I'll have to pay INR 12000 if I want it repaired.I also noticed after searching on internet that this is a very common problem and many customers have faced similar issues   with the hinge. So this clearly is a manufacturing problem. Hp is neither fixing this problem nor covering it under warranty ( I still don't know the reasons for not being covered in warranty ). This is unacceptable.

My case is about Hinge, which is made up a tough material and that was broken and logged the case against that on 21st March then it was approved by hp team that this will be repaired under warranty but due to delaying time process from hp another part of my laptop broken i.e. Back CoverThis back cover was broken only because hinge was broken after that hinge requires more space inside back cover. When engineer escalated this then your evaluation team rejected this part and said this will not cover under warranty and also rejected hinge part after initial approval and they provided me quotation. My point is very simple due to your Hinge material (very tough), hinge broken as well as your delayed process for resolving the case broken my back cover. And one very important thing, due to hinge today only back cover is broken and if it leads to my screen then for that also I’ll not responsible of that rather than HP company will responsible for that and this hinge and back cover issue too. I feel shame on the employees who are working in hp. They are not even capable of making decisions in a single shot. At once they are approving and saying that this comes under warranty and then after rejecting that by saying no this doesn’t comes under warranty.And one special thing whoever in your evaluation team but they need to have some common sense atleast to understand the case.As well as Support Team, On 24th March nearby 1pm, I called to Hp Customer Care and clearly mentioned that I got a call from your hp team 1-2 minutes earlier, can you just inform them to call back me as that number is one way. Then She said Yes sure I’ll inform the team and I mentioned to inform me as well after informing them then also she said sure but she never called me and still no callback came from your HP team. I think I must appreciate this on social media about the performance of HP company and their services, How they are not punctual? , How they are not even sincere about work?, How they do not understand the severity and priority of the case. Again they don’t have any common sense as well, Their Support Team are finalizing everything with final statement without indulging evaluation team. So, I request you to resolve my case asap and with any quotation because this issue are increasing day by day due to delay process of HP.

The left hinge on my laptop has completely broke. The screws holding the plastic to it have fallen out and have plastic in the ferrules, so the plastic on the boards are damaged. This computer had this problem a year and a half ago, and it was covered under a warranty at Best Buy. They must not have done a good job because now I face the same problem again, and this laptop is only 3 years old. With both the Best Buy and HP warranties expired, what are my options for self-repair? What are the sizes of the screw parts?

Same as everyone else here. My laptop started grinding last year, less than a year after purchase. I read that replacing the hinge would do nothing and with young kids, covid and such was not able, and couldn't be without the laptop.
Today the hinge opened and led to the screen cracking. Do I really need to describe this with all of the complaints about this issue? How is it in anyway reasonable that a laptop of this price is going to fail so completely shortly after warranty. I want a replacement. A stronger one. It has never been dropped. My old Toshiba lasted me 9 years. This is an absolute joke.

Hi! My HP Notebook 17 is almost 3 years now and I know I don't have any warranty anymore. I have a broken hinges both right and left and I can't seem close it anymore (I'm afraid that if I forcibly close it, it will be totally broken). After searching in the internet if someone has the same issue that I have, I realize that this is a common problem. I am totally careful in my gadgets (I have 2 Lenovo's, one more than 7 years and the other is almost 5 and I don't have a problem with the  hinges at all). My HP notebook is just setting in my desk for this past almost 3 years, never dropped it or anything like that. In short, I don't believe this not because of how I use my notebook but it is because of how it was built. So, my question is, how can I get an HP Support Service to fix this and if HP would cover the service? I am looking forward for response. Thanks in advance.

Hello, I purchased an HP envy x360 laptop about 1 year and 1 month ago. I take very good care of my laptop, as it was very expensive, and I have never dropped it or done anything to cause this issue. I have never had issues with my laptop until 7 days ago, when I was using it in tablet mode. When I was unfolding it back into normal laptop mode, the left hinge completely cracked and gave in. The crack in the hinge has spread to the screen and any moment now I feel like the whole laptop is going to completely fall apart. I can no longer use it in tablet mode (which I should be able to), because if I tried to fold it into tablet mode again, it would break even more. I have done my investigations on my laptop and I can tell that this is a very poorly designed hinge--the screws were embedded in pieces of plastic. I have also done my research on this issue and many other HP customers have also had the left hinge break at no fault of their own. I have contacted HP support several times, and no employee has done anything to fix the problem. I currently have my laptop taped together because HP support refuses to accept responsibility for this manufacturing issue. Considering this laptop was so expensive, it should definitely last longer than a year. I have explained to customer support that this was not a problem I caused, however they refuse to tell me anything other than it costs $300-400 to fix it because it is ""28 days out of warranty."" I understand why warranty exists, but a customer should not need to pay money to extend their warranty to fix something that the company itself is at fault for. If I dropped my laptop myself, or spilled water on it, then I understand that is my fault and I would need warranty, but it seems ridiculous that I have done nothing to cause this issue, and they wont fix it unless I pay $300-400 because it is one month beyond the warranty expiration date. The HP support employees were extremely uncaring and unhelpful to me--they interrupted me every time I tried to explain myself, and I had to argue with them to let me talk to the manager. When he finally said he would transfer me to the manager, I quickly learned the new HP support employee that he transferred me to was in fact also NOT the manager. So he lied to me. This is extremely unprofessional of such a well known company, and I expect HP to take responsibility for this very poor design, and either fix the hinge and screen at no charge, or replace the laptop because it clearly has a widespread issue of a faulty hinge.  I am a college student and literally cannot afford to spend even $100 to fix something that was not my fault. Please HP, recognize that many customers have this issue. Take responsibility for the poor design, and take care of your customers. I expect a repair or replacement at no cost, and if this is not taken care of I will gladly further escalate this issue.  Here are some links to show you that this is a very common issue and it needs to be addressed: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/17-quot-HP-Envy-Coming-apart-a... I am very surprised this product is not on recall considering how many customers have faced this issue.

I'm very careful with my laptop, I don't use the tablet mode at all, I only use it for gaming and internet. I called hp support and was basically brushed off and told if I don't want to pay over $400.00 for the repair then I should just buy a new computer. I'm disgusted by how poor the customer service is and even more disgusted at how poorly the laptop is built. Is there any remedy for this or is it better to just move on from hp permanently and buy a new computer from a better brand?

I had an authorized HP technician come to repair battery swelling and he reported that the hinges are a manufacturing defect and he has repaired several screens due to the hinge breaking and screen splitting. I realize this may be a long shot but, would you guide me in terms of how I can get the screens replaced. It is my hope that HP may help me repair these laptops for the kids. Thank you very much.

The laptop screen hinge on the right has separated from its foundation. This looks like poor design to me and I am an Engineer. The poorly designed plastic base for the mounting screws is the problem. I have bought HP Desk tops, Printers, Hp Laotops for frinds, I have recommended HP to friends, I have an Elite Book and an Envy (the one with a broken hinge) and many other HP products. I have taken the Envy apart and have looked at the poor design (thin  & small plastic peices holding a too tight metal hinge with a 17 inch heavy touch screen. This is me saying that unless HP gets in touch with me at the address in my log-in and offers a fix at no cost to me, I WILL NEVER EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER HP PRODUCT, NOR WILL I RECOMMEND HP TO ANYONE. This is rediculous!

I have issues with the hinges on my laptop.  I rarely close the laptop but when I did the other day, the hinge on the right side almost broke.  NO reason for that to have occurred as this laptop stays stationary since I purchased it August of 2020.  NOT under warranty unfortunately.  Any suggestions??

Hello!  We purchased the Envy x360 in mid-2017 and have had the left hinge break.  This seems to be a common defect in these laptops as reflected in the number of posts on this forum. The laptop has not been dropped, mishandled or modified in any way.  Never carried by the lid, etc.However, just last week my wife head a crack and the hinge mount popped up.  Upon inspection, it appears the plastic piece that the hinge attaches to within the lid housing is weak and has broken.  The screen still works at this point, but we are very careful to move the lid in order to avoid any additional damage. We assume HP will stand behind this manufacturing defect and resolve accordingly even though we are outside of our 1-year warranty.  My wife otherwise has been very happy with this computer and doesn't want to replace it with another brand at this time. Please contact us with next steps.  Thank you!

Hello HP Community, I opened up my HP Envy 360 Convertible this morning and the left hinge displaced and detached causing the screen to crack and fracture, left bottom towards the center.  The screen is hangin' on by one hinge!  Remarkably, and to my surprise, I am writing this post from said computer.   I took a look at the receipt, bought it 5.25.2018, it's just over two years old.  I love the computer and have always treated her with kindness and respect. I managed some brief research and found the hinge on this model is problematic.  I could sure use some help from HP Support in getting my Envy in for repairs and back in tip top shape as soon as possible.  Hangin' on by a hinge and respectfully waiting for a reply, Hotpoint57

I feel like I've been robbed by HP.I truly feel like I've been robbed and have no recourse and I know I will not receive the refund and service I paid for. The hinge of my HP is falling apart. I had to apply tape to it after just 2 months of owning it and with every month I'm adding more and more tape in different parts of my frame and now there is a huge crack growing from one corner to the next. All of this disintegration is happening without any pressure being put on my machine. I've left it open and havent closed it in about 8 months after first applying the tape. This is not my first HP hinge malfunction (it is my first time with this particular HP model) so I know how this story ends. there are thousands ripped off and unhappy HP customers with broken and weak hinge issues found ALL OVER THE INTERNET expressing their dissatisfaction and BEGGING for HP to assist them because they lack the money needed for repair. It's disgusting. And apparently there was a Class Action Lawsuit about the issue. Was anything fixed or changed in the design of the laptop because they are still falling apart for thousands. This is criminal.HP will ask that I send another photo of my laptop, but the damage is already done and the condition of my machine will look as if its been mistreated and I know I'll be blamed. This has happened before.  But the way my laptop looks after less than 1 year is HP's fault , not mine.   I feel like an even bigger fool because I had the hinge issue and so did my spouse about 5 years ago. I posted about it here. I got zero help. I wound up buying another HP and thought I was safe because it was a completely different model. THIS model was worse because I couldnt even enjoy it for 2 months. I now understand that multiple HP laptops//notebooks have the hinge issue that so many are being blamed for. HP makes millions and we consumers who spent hundreds and thousands in good faith are being screwed. I see complaints like mine dating back to 2014. Laptops are high ticket items, they cannot easily be replaced quarterly like some cheap appliance.  or a cheap calculator. This is unconscionable, immoral and flat out illegal.

						Hello,My HP Envy laptop is experiancing a problem with the left hinge/fan. The hinge is very loose and now I can't even open it properly. This laptop was NEVER dropped or mishandled as it sat on my desk at home almost all the time. Their is a gap in the casing now and it is interfering with the fan. This laptop is barely a year old and has software from my college installed on it. I can't afford expensive repairs. This laptop worked perfectly fine before this hinge started coming apart.This appears to be from a defective design, I'm surprised their hasn't been a recall. It seems other people on the forums have experienced a similar problem and was wondering if an HP Rep. could reach out to me.

I got my Envy laptop fixed twice already by getting the defective hinges replaced but they have broken for the 3rd time, causing me a lot of frustration.It's clear that the hinge design is sub-standard and the fix is temporary. The laptop is a 2012 purchase and gets a minimal weekend use. It was never dropped and hasno physical damage. The first two occurances of this issue were covered under warranty but the machine is not underwarranty now and the hinge problem seems to be a never ending one.I am definitely not willing to pay for something that occured not due to my negligence but due to HP's defective hinge design. Apart from this issue, it's a very good machine and I did never have any issues with it. Looking forward to a positive response and a PERMANENT fix as I have already suffered a lot due to this issue.

I have paid a lot of money for this laptop and when I looked it up a lot of people are having this same issue. Is there anything I can do? This is obviously a design issue, not a user issue because many other individuals have this same problem with this laptop. I love HP, but I don't know if the quality of this laptop was worth it. What can I do?

The right arm hinge of my laptop has broken and the corner of the screen was popping out. I opened my laptop just a moment ago to check on it, and now the bottom right of the screen has shattered due to the hinge bending it at an angle it shouldn't be. I can't open or close my laptop without the crack getting any worse. I'm afraid that the screen will stop working. I can't even bring it anywhere (to classes or to the repair shop) because I'm afraid that if I close it again, it will shatter even more. I'm in the middle of finals and am extremely frustred, I've had this laptop for just a bit over two years and am already experiencing many, many difficulties. It has not fallen, nor have I handled it roughly. Does anybody know what I can do or how much it would cost to repair it?

Hi I've got an issue with a HP EliteBook 745 G4. English speaking official support wont help me because I'm in Guatemala and not their area and I can't speak very good spanish. I'm hoping a clever tech-mind not condemned within the illusion of borders can help me here. The laptop was perched on a small box and due to a kitten attack it fell backwards by about 10cm onto a mattress and now the screen image is mangled. It was a very gentle fall, I'm surprised it even affected it. I think the screen bent backwards just that little bit too suddenly. Anyway, the screen isn't cracked externally, there is no noticeable physical damage. Something's cracked inside. The pixels react when I put pressure on the screen moving it back and forth on its hinge. It seems to be booting up fine. No beeps or lights. I can sometimes see the startup screen if I bend the screen but its only the top corner and I can't see enough to make any modifications easily. It's a great little computer with a lot of work on it, I'd really like to fix it. I bought it second hand in Mexico last year but it's still under warranty. Do you think it's a simple screen replacement? Or could it be another software/hardware issue? I have bought a cheaper replacement for now but I can't really work on it with its crappy specs. I'm hoping to use the screen however as a monitor for the broken one so I can test if its actually the screen that needs replacing. Does anyone have any experience with hooking up a second laptop screen to a broken one?  Keyboard commands etc.  I have a HDMI cable and I'm running Windows 10 on both.  So far my efforts have fallen flat. Any advice would be great, feeling a bit stuck at the mo. Thanks I-need-my-fix

Like many others my hinge has broken and taken the left lower part of the glass screen out with it. Is there an extended warranty on this poor design? I see wired and can't have this completely go out on me during work shall the wires break. I paid alot of money for this computer and it's only about 2 years old. I have been gentle with it from day one and I feel it's a poor design flaw. Half of my neighborhood works for HP here in Houston and are all familiar with it's issues  .Thanks

I bought my HP Envy 13 in September before starting my masters degree. Since then the hinge has broken twice (there are many other people with the same issue).  I sent it off to be repaired in October as it is under a year warranty, and it was repaired. But recently the same issue has happened once again. I took it to the store I purchased it from (Harvey Norman Nutgrove, Dublin) and they sent it off to be 'repaired'. After about three weeks I went back to the store to collect my laptop, only to find that it had been rejected as they claimed the damage was caused by 'accidental damage or misuse' which it clearly has not been due to the amount of customer complaints on the same issue in this platform. I then rang their support services team to contest this, as I am not paying for an issue that is clearly a factory fault and they were very unhelpful. They submitted me to a technical support case which I have not heard back from. I am wondering if anyone knows of any other ways I can contest this or resolve the issue? I am a student currently writing my thesis, but I obviously am restricted now because my laptop is broken. I am not willing to pay for an issue that is clearly a factory fault that keeps happening after spending a lot of my savings on this laptop. I will never buy another HP laptop after this one, and if anyone is thinking of spending money on a HP ENVY 13, save your money and buy elsewhere.

I have HP 250 G6 notebook. I got it in December 2017, and I am a very careful user. I never dropped the laptop. A few times I noticed some clicking type sound from left hinge but didn't think much of it, but a couple days back it completely broke and the screen is split. I got in touch with hp because I know it is a problem with the design not with how I used the laptop. They sent me a quotation for repair which is actually more than I originally paid for the brand new laptop 2 years ago. I'd rather buy a cheap used laptop right now than pay that much for a repair when I'm already struggling. Is this the only solution? Has anybody had it repaired themselves, not from hp, would it cost less? How much can I reasonably expect to pay for it? I have used many laptops over the years, Dell, Asus, others from HP and never experienced anything like this. My laptops never physically broke to be honest. And now they're asking for more than original price just for the repair, doesn't really make sense to me. Well, one thing is for sure I'm never buying HP again.

Today the left hinge on my 2 year old HP Envy x360 BROKE.  Now the screen has to be propped up to just to see it and I cannot use the touch screen feature unless I manually hold the screen while touching it. My computer just turned 2 years old and it is out of warranty.  Since this is a known manufacturer's design flaw, will HP do anything to repair my gently used computer?  This is disappointing that after it is paid for, the left hinge snaps loose.   Can anyone share how to complain to HP about this common issue with the HP Envy x360?  Otherwise, the computer still looks new.

I bought new HP ENVY X360 3 months ago in 29.08.21. Yesterday when I closed the screen I heard a cracking noise. I opened the laptop and found out that the right hinge was broken and out and there was a crack in the screen from the hinge attachment area. I contacted support today (11/15/2021), they checked laptop cracked screen and they told me that i couldn't prove that it wasn't my fault and they were unable to help, because it was not under warranty. it is clear breaking of screen was caused by broken hinge. The only way to prevent this issue would have been if I had known the hinge was faulty and never have opened or closed my laptop. Can anybody foresee that just closing the laptop simply would break hinge which at the same time would also crack the screen?! This is ridiculous.

I am having issues with an HP Envy 13 I bought with a 3-year Care Pack, which I immediately registered, and which HP has confirmed is still active. According to HP’s virtual assistant, my Care Pack covers “product failure due to hardware malfunction”, which is clearly what this is - it's not accidental damage, it's the result of a poor design and a product fault. After eight months of normal, careful use, a gap began to appear around the hinge and a clicking noise occurred when the laptop was opened or closed. A week later some small pieces of broken plastic fell out of the laptop.I was a little delayed in raising a support case because of the coronavirus lockdown - I wasn’t able to access an alternative computer, so I had no choice but to keep using my laptop, and made sure to be very careful with the hinge – since identifying the problem, I’ve opened/closed it no more than ten times. Then I had a period where I wouldn’t need to use my laptop, so I opened a case with HP support. I got in touch with HP Support over the phone, and they asked me to email them pictures and a recording of the fault, which I duly did, though I didn't recieve a reply. I followed up via email to confirm that they’d received my pictures, and once again, I had no reply. I called HP a little over a week later, and the automated assistant told me to contact them via WhatsApp; I duly did so, asking for an update on my case number, and again received no response.As a student, I’m very dependent on my laptop, which was a big expense for me and essential to my studies, so I’ve taken very good care of it: it’s never been dropped, I always use it at a desk (often on a stand with an external keyboard and mouse, so I’m not even touching it), and I carry it in an HP official case designed for this laptop. There is no other sign of damage to the case, demonstrating the good care I take of it. This problem is clearly the fault of a very poorly designed hinge which is unable to withstand even basic and standard use. Others have posted about this previously, for example https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-13-2019-Hinge-Issues/t... where several people indicate the exact same problem, so it's not an isolated incident.I finally got through to HP Support over the phone three days later. The support assistant initially told me that I still needed to send a picture of the problem. I asked her to look for my email, and she found my response from two and a half weeks before. She looked over the pictures with an engineer at HP, and told me that the problem wouldn’t actually be covered by my Care Pack. She offered to put me through to someone in the sales department, who quoted me over £300 for a repair, and then offered modest discounts and vouchers to put against a new purchase. But I shouldn’t have to pay anything for a faulty laptop that went wrong after just 8 months of normal use. I’m now forced to use my laptop as, essentially, a desktop – I’m afraid to move it anywhere, even into the kitchen to study, in case the hinge breaks more and the case comes fully apart, breaking it for good, exposing it to dust, etc. I depend heavily on my laptop and it’s incredibly frustrating that not only did it break in such a short period of time, but that HP has been unwilling to honour the terms of the warranty and Care Pack, under which I should be able to recieve a free repair.

My laptop's hinge to convert the laptop to a tablet has broken and the screen popped out.  The screen pops back in, but the resistance in the hinge forces the screen to pop out every time.  It will no longer close all he way.  I need to understand how to have the laptop repaired under warranty as it is covered till July 2020.   Thanks,Mike

obv these pictures and small clip is abit older nd so my hinges have gotten abit worse. I risk further damaging it when I physically close my screen.
 
Would the warranty cover broken hinges?

Pretty straight forward, came home to 2 screws falling out at the bottom of the screen, while the bezel being loosened from the screen. There has also been a disruption in network reach after this - somehow couldn't reach my own network only but 6-7 metres away from my office, moving closer helped while I previously had no problem moving around my PC, I do however now. 
The PC works fine if not but the 2 faults given, but opening and closing the screen has been nerves-wrecking, being me afraid of crushing a display cable/connector.

Over the past 18 months I've purchased 17 14"" HP laptops for the charity I work for, to enable our staff to work remotely and continue supporting our clients, during the pandemic. On three of the laptops, the right hand hinge fastenings have now failed where the hinge bracket screws into the plastic base and this is also causing difficulties in charging the laptops. The case flexes open when the lid of the laptops are opened or closed and the charging port ""floats"" about. I'm now really worried about the hinges failing in the other laptops as the charity simply doesn't have the funds to buy replacements and they're now out of warranty. Please can anyone tell me if they've had a similar problem and if so, whether they found a solution?

My screen is also coming apart and I have only had it for just about two years. The hinge is broke and it does not close I do not know what happened. It was fine and I opened it today and heard a click, the screen had popped out on the right-hand side near the hinge. It seems that this *may* be a manufacturing fault from all the posts I have read with respect to this issue.I honestly haven't been rough with it or done anything that might cause this. I love this laptop and treat it with extreme care. There is nothing to warrant the screen to come apart. I can't believe its broken.I wonder if HP can repair this as It seems unreasonable to me that this should happen.

I own a HP Envy x360 and Pavilion x360.  Both of these has a broken hinge which does not allow the screen to open without causing damage. History:  My Envy is about two years old and this problem started about a year ago.  I figured it was from the amount of travel I do for work.  This was my primary work travel computer as well as being my personal use computer.  The left side hinge started with a small popping noise and has now cause extensive screen damage, enough to where it is completely unusable. My Pavilion is about 1 1/2 years old and was a gift for my wife.  This computer stays stationary and does not travel.  Last week it started having the same issue but on the right side.  No screen damage yet. From searching through the community I see this is a fairly common problem.  Is there a fix or recall put in place by HP for a possibly defective screen hinge? Thank you for any and all input.

Hello, This thread is to show the terrible experience I have had with HP for the past several months. In February 2019 I purchased an HP Laptop. The laptop worked fine until about January 2020  when it started showing signs of problems - first a small popping sound when closing the laptop, (that I did not think much about) the right side of the laptop separating from the rest when being closed (did not seem that severe as it could be simply popped back it) and eventually breakage on the side, right arm/hinge being cracked and bulging of the laptop accompanied by a crunching noise (I haven't tried to close the laptop for several months for this reason) and severe wifi problems making the laptop basically unusable as it can barely connect to the Internet . I did not do ANYTHING to cause these problems and it  is an obvious manufacturing defect. The problems did not seem severe enough to warrant contact HP at the time the warranty lapsed but they got progressively worse and now the laptop is basically unusable. This just so ""happened"" to occur right after the time where the 1 year warranty lapsed. At the end of March/Early April I contacted HP via phone and was not able to reach them due to the out of warranty department being closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I made this thread below in early April as well as another a few days before: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Laptop-physically-breaking-sho... After a couple weeks of messaging a representative I was told the out of warranty department was closed but was offered a $75 coupon as compensation that I have not used and will probably never use as I doubt I'll buy from HP again. Over the next couple of months I tried calling HP several times but never managed to get through to the out of warranty department due to the pandemic. Through all this time I was never even given a case number. When I finally did reach the out of warranty department - perhaps early July - I was told that it would cost over $300 dollars  to fix my laptop. The representative also told me there were no ""red flags"" on the product meaning there were no known manufacturing problems. Considering HP laptops are known to have this problem with the hinge/arm breaking it simply amazing that I would be the first person to ever call about the problem on this particular model. A simple Google search shows that this is a common problem among other model of HP laptops. And obviously it's also problem with my model as well. I filed a complaint on HP's website as well as with the BBB and was offered a 40% discount through the BBB by HP to fix my laptop. (I was told by an HP representative that she was NOT contacting me about the BBB complaint. A few days later, the same 40% discount offer says it was declined on the BBB website) HP says they ""apologize"" but wants me to charge me about $190 to fix THEIR manufacturing problem that they won't admit to because my laptop is out of warranty. I don't see how that is much of an apology.  Of course, this problem magically occurs at around the time the warranty expires so of course it would be out of warranty by the time you contact them. Funny how that works out. So now I am stuck with a $400 laptop that doesn't work and HP wants me to pay another $190 to fix their manufacturing defect that they refuse to admit to. On top of that the customer service has been horrific - from the waiting to the inability to contact the right people to the fact I was told a call was in not in regards to a BBB complaint when it was.  I have contacted HP via phone, complaints and email as well as the BBB and have gotten virtually nowhere so I am posting this thread to share with the HP community now. I have tried to be patient, polite, and understanding over the past several months but I have had enough. This thread is to share my experience with HP for the last several months and to warn other people about how HP products ""work"" and how badly HP treats their loyal customers. We have purchased HP computers for over a decade and as it stands we will not be purchasing them again. As a final point, another HP customer had a similar problem with an out of warranty laptop in 2015 that I will link below. Their laptop was fixed for free by HP but I am expected to pay $190 to fix mine. It goes to show how far HP has deteriorated both in quality and customer service in the past few years. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Left-Hinge-Broken-Corner-of-La... Please share your thoughts below if you wish.   Edit: Sorry I accidentally put the wrong link to the thread the other person made about their laptop being fixed for free. It's fixed now.

I purchased a HP laptop for the first time so I went on a laptop available for the lowest price because I don't know how much a laptop last. I purchased G6 250 because the HP recommended me that business laptop are much more durable. I use my laptop on a table just like a desktop I never took my laptop while travelling but in a timespan about 2 years my laptop noted issues with motherboard(3 times), hard-disk(1 time)(Yeah, I was also confused), network card(1 time), suddenly hinge too. I first call up the onsite and they told me that the hinge was broken from inside (without even opening the laptop) then I took it to a service centre they also told me that it can only be done in a chargeable basis. The twist: The onsite service customer care was also done without opening of the laptop and they sent the parts. The service centre (Sysnet Global at Bowbazar) sent me a quotation of about 5k in onsite and 16k at offsite for the same issue. Now I was actually confused whether was there any problem or not so I took it to a actually professional the professional just loosen the hinge and a tighten a screw which came out and the laptop was fixed in just 30 mins and the onsite and offsite took 16 days for the same issue I just want to know why there are so huge difference between the service centre and the onsite serive and my laptop didn't needed any parts to be replaced. From the above attached picture it can easily be noted that there was no physical damage. Even when I took my laptop to that professional I visited a rog centre for my next laptop and I was not alone 2 people with the same event visited that rog store the shop staff told me I would like that HP takes a hard decision on the sevice centre because if that service centre is doing it to almost every one if this doesn't stop HP is going to make a huge loss in Kolkata. This monopoly started when Sysnet Global was the only service centre at the heart of the city and they don't have a good reputation you can even go to the actual ground situation.

HP Envy Laptop, I received in August 29, 2020, so the 1 year warranty expired. Never dropped, I use it normally for personal home use. I open and close the laptop as I normally do, then after one year of normal use, I tried closing the laptop and the hinge pops the corner of the screen. This is a really big issue because it is literally going to crack the screen whenever I want to close the laptop. So now my laptop stays open always. This is an issue that is clearly from the HP Envy series with an issue with the hinge. Without warranty HP won't fix my laptop with the fault which is at HP? Even cars sold have callbacks when they create faulty parts. Researched around, this is a very common problem for this Envy laptop. If I had known HP would use subpar crap parts, I wouldn't have purchased this laptop. Honestly a complete waste of money. Also this laptop presents more problems than just this known one which I have experienced. This HP envy series poses many issues and without a doubt the worst laptop I have ever used in my 20 years of using many various laptops. If you have the option to return this thing I advise you to save yourself a headache and get rid of this.  Called HP, speaking with customer support, they said they can't do anything without warranty.  Does anyone have a fix for this horrendous issue?

 I purchased a HP envy touch smart i7 laptop in 2014 from Bangladesh. But after using it for 3 months the hinge broke off and one side cover is gap open where hinges broke. I was wondering how could it happen? As I didn't do any forcing on this.So I took it to the computer source the distributor from whom I purchased it. They told me it is not under warranty cover as the parts is broken. So I am using it like that for 2 years as PC. So I don't have to close the lid. But Now I know there is a lot of people facing the same problem. Hinges broken problem.  So I would like to ask If this is a manufacturer defect? and What is the solution for broken hinges?

My wife has been battling using her M7 Envy since the left hinge went bad. Long story short we went out yesterday and got her and New Envy 360. She will open up work on 1 to 3 PCs/Laptops by the way. With the additon of the 360, she can keep up to speed while I look into fixing it now....I have already noticed that the M6 users have been able to get them fixed. I need to see what can be done to fix the hinge.(Hoping for a moderator to hop in at this point and guide this old whitebox OEM on)Thanks in advance!

I got in contact with the support (tedious process). I got a quote for 460€, which means that an easy repair like opening the thing up, replacing a cent-screw and closing it and this whole thing being a huge design error by the manufacturer suppositly renders my laptop totaled. I refuse to pay this. As I need my computer I will try to get it repaired by a third party. But I will not buy HP again in the near future even though I was super satisfied with the product until the hinge screw broke.

Hello,The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner and two screws fell out together with some small, plastic pieces.My warranty ran out last June (2019). I literally moved the laptop an inch to the right and the hinge broke. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way, rather taking really good care of it, considering I had to pay close to $1,000 for it. Based on the tons of complaints around this same problem on this forum (and elsewhere) it is obvious that the hinge design is really poor.I am obviously very unhappy with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem.A computer in this price range should not break after just more than one year of normal usage!

So I've had this laptop for a few year and may haven't really opened and closed it less than 100 time (I mainly use it as a desktop and use a hdmi cable). Not to long ago I went to open it and I realized my left hinge was coming apart and not really sure the best route to get it fixed. I would assume it would have to be some sort of defect for me not have opened it to many time and for it to start coming. Any help will be great, thanks.

HP touch screen notebook model 15-bs013dx has top case that is cracked and coming apart over the left hinge.  It is less than 2 years old, but of course the warranty is expired.  It has always been ""stiff"" opening and closing which put too much stress on the hinges.  I have noticed in previous threads that many other people have had the same problem and that HP has been cooperative in repairing this, since it seems to be a manufacturing defect.  Hoping that they will see this and take care of mine also.

I bought this laptop in November 2018 during a black friday sale.  Recently, I closed my laptop and I heard a crack sound.  Upon closer observation, I realized that my laptop's central hinge is broken and tearing away from the base.  This is also causing the panels on the front and back of the screen on the right side of the laptop to tear away from the screen.  Based on the wide number of similar posts by other purchasers that I have read, I can only assume that the problem resides with the shoddy parts and hardware on this model, as opposed to just normal wear and tear.   I'd like to have this repaired as soon as possible.

Somehow, two of the screws at the bottom of my laptop are gone. The screws are at the top right and left near where I close and open my laptop. I  have no idea where they went or when I lost them but I need to order some more. I do not know what type they are and where to find them. Without the screws, when I have to close my laptop I have to push down more to make sure it is completely closed or it will act as if I never closed it. Also, the laptop is partially coming apart so I would like this fixed asap. Furthermore, somehow the long gripping of the laptop at the bottom (the two parts that make sure my laptop doesn't slide) are falling off as well. I just want to know if it is safe to use regular glue to put the gripping back on my laptop before it falls off again and I lose it. Thank you so much. I hope if anyone has this problem that they also get it solved.

						Only a matter of weeks after buying the Spectre I've started to notice loud creaking and clicking noises every time the screen is moved or any pressure is added to the hinge. The issue mainly affects the left side hinge. This is a bit of an issue because I swap from laptop to tablet mode many times throughout the day and the nasty creaking is quite the annoyance.

The hinge on my laptop suddenly broke for no reason and is pushing the screen up and out of place so it will no longer close properly.  The computer is just over two years old.  This is apparently a problem that HP has known about for many years which is aggravating.  This was an expensive 17"" laptop that I did not want to replace yet.  Does anyone know if the company will stand by its product, or should I start shopping for a new computer with another brand?

I gave my daughter a laptop for Christmas 2019. Apparently several months ago (while the laptop was still under warranty) the screws from one of the hinges came loose inside the laptop, and they won't tighten up again. The hinge is basically not connected to the base of the computer any more. I didn't learn about this until this week. The warranty officially expired on 12/16/2020. Is it possible to get grace on the warranty expiration to get this fixed? (This is one of three HP laptops that we own, and the first time we've had an issue that needed warranty repair.)Thanks you in advance.

Now the other hinge broke and due to COVID 19 I can not take it to Best Buy. I tried calling the support line and have not been able to speak to a live person about repairing this issue. The support line keeps redirecting me to the virtual chat and that is of no use either. Is there anyway to actually talk to someone at HP to resolve my issue. I am extremely disappointed in this product. A computer that is meant to fold into a tablet should not be breaking at the hinges.

Hello, I bought a HP TouchSmart Notebook almost 4 years ago, and there have been no problems as I’ve kept it in good condition. However, I noticed that the hinge was starting to be problematic, to the point where I cannot open the laptop anymore. If attempting to open it, the hinge locks and the screen starts to rip off of the body. I’ve looked around and saw that this is a common problem with these notebooks. Although mine is out of warranty, I want to know if there is a way to get it fixed, without losing anything I had on the laptop. It was a great product and I took care of it, but I am extremely disappointed that I could lose everything just because of a faulty hinge. If there is a way to get the hinge replaced or fixed, please let me know. I would also like to know how others have handled this common problem. Thank you

 Anyone else have a problem with the display hinges on the HP Pavilion x360 coming apart ? With my laptop, the lcd screen detached from the back lid without getting dropped or mishandled in anyway . Laptop stays put in one place actually. Simply used it one day and the next day when I opened it, it let out a horrible creaking sound. The display had come apart and was ‘drooping’ on one side. For reference  I bought slightly over a year ago ( so I’m out of warranty).  Laptop has had issues from the go. HP support wanted me to part with cash to get it fixed. Hope hp gets my problem and solve it for me

I have never dropped it nor abused it, however, just about 3 days ago the screen hinge from the bottom left side broke unexpectedly as i was simply opening it like every normal day. My warranty expired a while back, however,  never used it due to the fact I take care of my stuff. Is there anyone who can help me get it fixed from HP since I wasn't at fault at all? I did research and came across a large number of people with this same issue. My HPenvy360 is working perfectly fine as there is no cracked screen nor dents. The operating system is working fine as well. I am a student that is about to begin school in a couple of weeks and don't feel comfortable using this laptop as it is. I am afraid the screen will end up breaking. Can someone help me plz?

Hello! I see that I’m not the only one but my Envy Laptop screen has decided to just fall off!

The screen will not even stay up anymore! I’ve never dropped this computer and I’m the only user so I know it is well taken care of! And of course it’s out of warranty! what do I do now?

My HP Envy m7 Notebook is having issues with the left screen hinge popping in and out of place.  Reading the online message boards here and elsewhere, this seems to be a known issue with HP Envy laptops (link below). I am currently able to use the laptop, but am concerned about the damage spreading to the rest of the screen. My laptop is more than a year old and outside its warranty window.  However, given the frequency this issue seems to occur with HP Envy laptops, I was wondering if HP had a standard fix/replacement plan in place.  Apart from this mechanical issue, I have been satisfied with the laptop's performance overall. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Left-Hinge-Broken/m-p/...

Hello,My HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15m-bp1xx left hinge broke and the left corner is cracked and bulging. When I tried to close it then left hinge was somehow cracking leaving some small particles and not letting me close it anymore (too scared to close it further so I started to google this problem.) The laptop was never dropped or fell.  My laptop seems working ok but I am scared to close it now and screen on the left is kinda separating. It seems like the screw from the lower case are falling off and I am not able to close and open the laptop properly. The warranty is expired on this laptop.  I owned this laptop less than 2 years now (purchased 11/27/2017 ) I also could find some other thread that had the same issue with me seemed that some people were getting help from hp...?  but I do not know what to do.Please help.  Thank you in advance.

Dear Sir/Madam HP Envy 17"" Laptop:  Left hinge broken and LHS screen display coming away from casing I purchased a HP Envy 17"" laptop from Currys PC World on 24 Nov 2018 with the standard 1-year warranty.  I didn't extend the warranty, purely because I have another HP laptop (Compaq Presario A900) which I've had for 12 years and never encountered a problem with that device to date. On the week commencing 31 Aug 2020, my Envy laptop started making a creaking noise on the LHS whenever I was typing on my keyboard and then on 2 Sep 2020 when I opened the laptop the left hinge had broken and the display screen had come away from the casing.  Occasionally, a couple of screws and broken pieces of plastic fall out of the device when I now close the laptop lid.  Please find photos below of what my machine looks like in its current form. Seeing that I paid a lot of money for this device and although my warranty has expired, I would not have expected a high-end priced model to have such a design flaw.  Reading through the HP Community support pages, I now realise that this is a common engineering design fault with the HP Envy 17"" laptop.  As the laptop is not of a satisfactory quality, considering the price I paid, I would be grateful if someone could get back to me and advise what I should do. Yours faithfully

We have 4 HP computers of various types , but this is an exorbitant price ( nearly half the laptop price for a well known fault according to the forums.) I feel its such a pity for a company as well known as HP not to help more!!  Very disappointed , it should definitely affect future purchase decisions especially for students, my daughter is very sad.

Now there is a gap between the screen and the laptop lid. It seems the plastic was not strong enough to hold the screw.Is HP providing any support for this issue?

The hinge is broken on my laptop, thus the corner of the bottom plastic cover is broken. I actually have 2 HP 17"" laptop computers with the same issue (seems like a design flaw). Is there anywhere I can get a replacement bottom cover? One of my laptops is silver and one is blue - I can only find gold replacement covers (on amazon) at this point.  I have also searched other retailers, but with no luck.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi.The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner and two screws fell out together with some plastic ""crumbles"".I bought my computer from the HP store 2017, and obviously the 1 year warranty is out. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way, rather taking really good care of it, but based on the tons of complaints around this same problem on this forum (and elsewhere) it is obvious that the hinge design is really poor.I am obviously very unhappy with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem.A computer in this price range should not break after normal usage!

It is out of the one year warranty but within two. I honestly didn’t believe a pricey but nice laptop like this would fail within a couple of years. im so devoed.

Hi, I have a 17z laptop that I purchased about 16 months ago.  The laptop is really only about 14 months old, because we had to send it back originally because the touch screen did not work.  The laptop has run perfectly since HP corrected the screen until now.  The right hand hinge has broken and proceeded to crack the case.  We have not dropped the laptop nor had any opportunities for damage.  It has become increasingly more difficult to use, because opening and closing the laptop will further the damage.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Thanks in advance!

I bought my laptop around 2 years ago. Recently one hinge has become loose and the back casing is now pulling away from the screen in that corner. This makes the laptop difficult to close, it also seems to be a common issue with these laptops based on the number of people who have had a similar experience. I am hoping this issue can be repaired as I expected this laptop to last until I have finished university. I have tried to find a number to call but have had trouble finding a one for an out of warranty product. If someone could direct me to the correct place that would be great.ThanksJess

  So this piece of crap computer continues to have problems with pieces breaking. I’ve had it for two years and I’ve never dropped it or done anything to cause anything to break. As you can see in the picture, the hinge is completely broken (the metal literally broke in half) and two of the screws that’s held the hinge to the cover also broke off of the cover and the plastic piece that connects both hinges also broke. As well as that the right mouse button broke and is stuck into the computer. I cannot find anything to show me how to fix any of these problems and I’m a college student so I can’t afford a new computer and I can’t afford to send it somewhere to be fixed especially don’t have time to have it put into a shop since college just started back two days ago. I really don’t know what to do because warranty ended a year ago and to an extent I think HP should fix it free of charge because none of this is my fault these are factory issues because they created a piece of **bleep** computer. Hard drive is fine except the disk starts running at 100% occasionally and I have to erase everything off of my computer to fix it. But besides that all of my issues are dealing with the plastic pieces of the laptop.

I’ve had my Envy for 4 years.  I’m not rough with it, it generally sits on a desk and doesn’t move. I was just on an 8 day trip (laptop was not with me).   No one was in my house while I was gone however when I got home and went to open it to do some work, the casing completely separated from the screen and one of the hinges seems to have broken.   Pieces have literally fallen out of the gap that now exists.  I’ve taken pics but it seems impossible to find a good email for customer service.    Apparently my warranty expired in 2019.  Is there nothing that HP will do?   This was not a cheap laptop and should have lasted longer than 4 years, especially when it doesn’t get moved around much at all.  I’ve been loyaL to this brand for a long time, so I’m incredibly disappointed in this.  Thanks!

Where do i send my HP Envy laptop for a hinge repair? It is a month old and the left hinge has already broken.  The HP website is not very helpful when it comes to this issue.  Thanks for your help! I was finally able to Chat with an agent and they basically said it was my fault the hinge broke and that it would cost me $399 for the repair.  I did some additional digging  and discovered that this is a known issue (exact same pics as my problem) and there are multiple class action lawsuits regarding the hinges.  I am not sure why HP just does not own this problem and fix my month old laptop - not a good way to keep customers.

I know it used to work fine.I have tried every suggestion HP offers online for this issue. I've also tried a few from other support websites. This includes but is not limited to: uninstalling the camera (HP Truevision HD) and reinstalling, uninstalling the viewing programs (such as Cyberlink Youcam 6) and reinstalling, updating, restarting my computer, updating Windows, making sure I only try to view the video in one program at a time, scanning for changes, updating device, enabling driver, and more. I just want to be able to use my laptop's camera!

Hello. How are you.I will explain my problem the best way I can. My HP laptop will not turn on, I plug in the adapter, the power indicator light illuminates white, when I plug the battery in it turns amber....indicating that it is charging, and it is charging the battery, it turns white when its done. I know the battery is good, I know the adapter is good. When I press the power button nothing, absolutely nothing happens......no lights on the keyboard.....nothing. I have done all the easy test, remove ram remove hard drive, button combos, held down buttons, still, the board will not turn on. I know the board itself is getting power at the adapter terminals, tested with a multimeter.....but I dont know were to go from there. I swapped mother board from one laptop to another, because one was damaged beyond repair, the plastic hinge mount was broken in pieces. I purchased an asis laptop that worked but had screen issues, the one Im trying to save is a better laptop, or board, than the one I bought. I also replaced the screen with issues, with the screen from my laptop. I unpluged the bios battery let it sit over night that didnt work. Both laptops worked without any issue, until I swapped motherboards. I even put the mobo from the one I bought for parts, back in, and it is having the exact same problem.... not turning on. Both laptops worked before I swapped motherboards, now both laptops do not work. If anybody, made it this far, thank you. Any help, is greatly appreciated, thank you very much.

So, the left hinge on my laptop has broken.  It is causing the screen case to crack. I have called support, and I cannot even speak to a person without agreeing to a minimum fee of $50.  If I have to pay that just to get an answer, I'll put that money toward a different manufacturer's machine that might last.  This computer sits on my desk at the house, and barely gets opened and closed.  My work computer (different brand) gets opened and closed several times a day.  Carried to and from work, and is still rock solid.   So, are these horrible hinges replaceable or not???  Simple question if someone would answer the **bleep** phone.

I bought this laptop three years ago and my left hinge has been broken days ago. Now I cannot close my laptop lid without feeling tension from the bending plastic. It keeps pulling on the plastic when closing or opening the lid (bottom cracking caused by the hinge). Some of the plastic fins are missing where the heat exhaust is. I cannot believe this is the HP product. I used to have a Toshiba laptop for about 10 years and none of hardwares was broken. Please advise how to fix it. Thanks!

I am not sure if I put this under the right question but I have been having issues with my laptop. This summer, one day I went to open my laptop and I heard a loud crack and snap, and it looked that the hinge on the left side broke. My laptop ended up being okay and there was no more damage, so I continued to use it without repairing it since that would be expensive. I was just super careful with it. However, yesterday I went to open my laptop very slowly, and the left side of the screen popped out, and it wont pop back in. Whenever I adjust my screen now, it makes loud cracks, and I am too afraid to close my laptop. Now I am really unable to take this laptop anywhere, and I have no idea how to transport it without causing more damage. I have never dropped or caused any damage to this laptop, this has just all happened on its own, which is somewhat frustrating. I have had this laptop since about August 2018. I am not sure what to do, or what even needs to be repaired. I am assuming at least the left hinge, but I am not sure about the screen. The screen does not have any cracks or anything, but it is coming out on the left bottom side. Please let me know what I should do and how to go about getting this repaired, and if there is a number I can call to get further assistance.

How can HP stand behind this product when it is breaking and customers have been complaining for years? What is HP as a company doing to rectify this situation? What is HP going to do for me as a customer? Thank you

I purchased 2 of the same HP laptops Dec. 2019.  They are the worst laptops I ever had in my life.  I paid $2,000 Dec. 2019 for these laptops and they are totally useless.   The hinges on my laptop completely broke off a couple of weeks ago and the screen separated from the body.  I brought it in for repair and was told it's not worth repairing, all the plastic around the hinge bolts was shattered and the battery had 3 bubbles in it and were likely to leak.  They were able to extract my data for a total cost of $275.00. Both of these laptops have AMD A9-9425 RADEON R5, 5 COMPUTE CORES 2C+3G 3.10 GHz processors.  At first my broken laptop ran great, but my wife's always ran slow.  In any case I am using my wife's HP since mine is useless and came to find out the processor in this laptop is not support for a Windows 11 upgrade.   Not for nothing, but after my experience with these 2 HP laptops and the printer I have, I will never purchase an HP product again and I am going to make sure everyone who asks me for a recommendation knows that HP is at the bottom of my list.  I also see it's impossible to contact HP unless I pay them for their time.  With those 2 factors in mind, they lost what would have been a customer for life.I am going to purchase a new ASUS laptop for myself as they provide a solid product that I have never had an issue with, customer support is outstanding, plus you get more for your money.  My rant is over.

My laptop is out of warranty expired 11/30/20 but about 6 months ago my hinge broke. I have been trying to research this issue and seems not to be a recurring problem. There is no other damage to the laptop, and it was never dropped or abused. The hinge simply failed under normal use after only a couple of years, and I don't understand why. I have purchased numerous HP Desktops and Laptops and haven't had any major issues.

I bought my Envy x360 laptop 18 months ago and the right hinge just made a loud snap noise and broke. Now the screen is starting to separate, and I can't close the laptop.  I understand that my laptop is out of the 1 year warranty period but hinges that last for only 18 months are not acceptable!  I wish I had known about the hinge issue with these laptops before I bought it.  Is there a way to determine which parts I need so I can get this fixed?

Wow. I did not realize how many people have the same issue with a broken hinge. I babied my laptop and the reward was a broken hinge? I called the authorized dealers in my area. $200.00 for a manufacturing flaw is not acceptable. Help!

My son has an HP Envy x360 Laptop that he uses very carefully and properly for school. It has not been dropped or otherwise damaged in any way, (as photos will attest). The hinge has broken from inside the laptop after only 8 months of normal use.  I spoke to HP customer service and they say the repair is not covered because hinge damage is considered ""Customer Use Damage."" ? Opening and closing a hinge is part of the proper use of a laptop, this has nothing in common with water damage or drop damage that should fall under that description. This is akin to saying a car warranty will not be honoured because the car was driven.... The offered repair cost is over $300. Does HP stand by their products? Or are they just going to pawn off shoddy build quality onto their (once) loyal customers? I definitely would not buy or recommend HP again.

The left hinge on my laptop is broken.  I was able to open and close it while holding the corner down but it is getting worse.  Now when I close it it pops open more and puts pressure on the side. It is no longer under warranty. I should have contacted HP when it first happened but I didn't think it was a big problem.  I've seen HP has fixed others for free.  I'm hoping they will do the dame for me.

You're not the only one here.
And to anyone reading this forum: Please stay away from HP products.
 
I've researched online, and found several cases where this happened. All of them have a few things in common: none of them have dropped or damaged the device, most of them it happened months after purchase, most of them use the device lightly and take good care of it (After all, it's not an inexpensive device!).
 
I bought the Envy x360 for my mother November 2017, who already distrusted HP as a brand, but I convinced her that they had changed for the better and that this was a premium product. Boy, was I wrong!
After about 6 months of usage, light usage, she opens the screen one morning and the display snaps off from the bottom left corner of the back panel! The hinge broke somehow, and it caused the display / screen to come off a little bit.
Nothing cracked and the touch still worked fine, but then the laptop couldn't be closed or used as a tablet (not that she ever did), or anything.
 
We sent it to support and of course, they label it as ""physical damage"" and the repair cost of $612.67 USD. Supposedly it was labeled ""damaged"" and ""outside of the product’s limited warranty coverage."" I mean... ""damaged"" is something that happens, even if accidentally, when one is not careful with something. Not when one does something completely normal and part of the required daily and normal function of a device.
 
It'd be like expecting the power button of an iphone to fail one random day. It just doesn't happen!
 
I'm going to write corporate and see what happens.
 
I already gathered screenshots from the forums and from Best Buy reviews (including mine). This is unacceptable.

For the second time since purchasing my laptop, I'm having an issue with the hinges. I had to have it repaired last year due to both hinges breaking, but thankfully, this time only one has decided to cause issues. I know I haven't done anything to actively cause the hinge to break, I've been particularly careful about it since the issue last year, and yet it's still happened. The left hinge has come almost completely loose and is preventing me from properly closing the laptop without fear of it snapping, and because of the dislodged pieces, the casing of my screen will sometimes come loose on the left side. What's the best way for me to remedy this?

Hello! I manage several hundred chromebooks and repair them as needed, and I've got one that I've seen twice now and not found a good solution for.  My issue is that we have a Chromebook 11 G3 that has a dark screen, very faintly you can see what should be displayed. Not a case of the brightness being turned down, but rather the LED backlighting on the screen appears not to be working. I've now tried replacing, screen, motherboard and display cable in an attempt to fix this issue. The screens were brand new, as were the replacement screen cables, though the mother boards were second hand. HDMI is still functional in all cases.  I have called HP support and not gotten any information other than ""replace the motherboard"".  As I have now seen this twice in the past month and all of those devices were purchased at the same time I have concerns that this may be more frequent.  I guess my question would be if there is a schematic for testing the boards or information on fuses that might have blown and could be jumpered or replaced. I would also love to know if anyone else is running into this issue. I would also be thankful for any resources on testing procedures for components like the screen and output on the eDP connector. I have a little background in electronics and don't mind testing and/or soldering. Also, I have already tried powerwashing/resetting the device to no avail, stating that as I know almost all of the support responses get that procedure pasted in as a fix. It is not for this issue.

What do I do...If I pay to fix, it would be more than a new computer would be. Of course that new computer won't be a 2-1 HP.

My laptop is less than 9 months old.The hinges have become disconnected from the screen. It appears that the screws no longer stay in their little holes in the plastic and they've all fallen out completely. As a result the screen is no longer able to stay up under it's own weight and I am very concerned that this will lead to further damage to the machine.  The laptop is only 9 months old and has never had any sort of incident. I can now see that this is a common issue with these machines as any cursory internet search will attest.  What is the suggested response to this ? Since this is clearly NOT because of my mis-handling of the laptop. As I've had this for less than a year I assume that I'm still covered by the warranty.

I can't believe I have to post in a forum to get hold of HP but here we are. I've had my laptop lid crack *twice* at the hinges through normal use because of the known design flaws in the x360 line (among others). I had the display lid repaired while it was under warranty, and now the lid has cracked *again*. No, I'm not going to pay for extended support on a known design flaw, whether the laptop is under warranty or not, thanks. HP, please repair, preferably with some kind of reinforced display case. Other users with the same issue:Main thread:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebooks-Archive-Read-Only/Defective-Hinges-on-HP-Laptops-Envy/td-p/5... https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Left-Hinge-Broken-Corner-of-La...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hp-Pavillion-Broken-hinge/m-p/...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/The-hinge-bracket-has-broken/m...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hinge-broken/m-p/7627612https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinge/m-p/8410384https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge/m-p/7670952https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-assembly-hp-envy-...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Hinge-Broken/m-p/...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinges/m-p/7937049https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-broken-hinge/m-p/83031...and on and on...

Hi, this laptop has broken hinges (both completely snapped through) and a damaged display panel. I see the hinges are no longer available on the HP parts store. I am wondering how cost effective/easy it will be to replace the hinges. I am in the UK and an ebay search is bringing up several display panels but just one possibility for a single hinge.If I can't find the hinges is there an alternative way to keep the laptop together or do I just give up, strip this one and use the money towards a new one?Thanks

The plastic covering the hinges are peeling off and I am out of warranty.  The hinge itself is in good condition and not broken. I am unable to open or close the lid without more of the plastic peeling off and tearing away from the lid. I use this laptop at home for work but NOT excessively.  Under normal usage the plastic covering the hinges on both sides have started to peel off which makes it harder for the laptop to close properly and now the plastic is tearing off from the frame. Is there any way to have this repaired before the internal hinges get damaged? I should not have to pay to have this fixed as it is clearly a manufacturing defect and not a physical damage from my side.  This laptop has never been dropped. I would appreciate if it could repaired ASAP as it is affecting my ability to work from home. Model: HP 250 G5 Notebook

REALLY DISAPPOINTED!  A little over a year ago, I purchased my 2nd HP Laptop.  Both laptops started coming a part at the screen & hinges.  The 1st one was a 15” & I thought maybe my son had done something to it.  He swore he hadn’t.  Now I know he is telling the truth because I purchased a 2nd one (17”) for myself & I know I hadn’t dropped it or damaged it in ANYWAY.    It stayed on my desk.  Today, I went to open the laptop & it began popping & parts began falling off.  Again, the screen is separating and the hinges are beginning to come a part.  Honestly, I have worked & sold computers for YEARS & I have NEVER seen anything like this.  I agree with other customers that there is definitely a design flaw in these HP Laptops.  I still have laptops around that are REALLY old and they are study as heck. Now I’m in a position of having to purchase another laptop & I as well will think twice before ever purchasing another HP.

My HP Envy laptop that I have owned for 1 and a half years has a broken display as a result of the right hinge failing, causing the screen to fall out of place and crack. There may also be damage to the LCD display. I have quickly found that this is a common issue and as a result of a design flaw in the laptop. This is extremely dissappointing considering the high price I paid for the laptop, and that this is no fault of my own. As a result I expect HP to repair my laptop despite its expired warranty.

I started to hear what sounded like rattling and broken pieces near my fan on the left side near the vent holes. When I lift up my laptop and tilt it, I can hear pieces falling inside near my fan. Sometimes when the fan turns on, the pieces move and make noise too. But they move and make noise and then stop, the noise does not continue while the fan is on. Basically, it sounds like little pieces of plastic move around and then stop unless i tilt it back and forth. But it's not a continuous noise. I looked in the vent holes on the left side and could see some of the grill (I think there is a metal grill inside the vent holes) has been pushed inward. The pushed in grill pieces don't seem to be moving, so it must be something inside that I can't see. The computer runs fine and the fan seems to be working. I am very careful with my computer and I have no idea how this could have happened. I saw a video on how to take the computer apart so I could take a look, but I figured I would ask before I go that route. Should I take it apart and check out the fan and see what's moving around in there? I purchased my computer 2 years ago, so I'm not sure if this is something HP would fix for free. Any help is appreciated. Thanks HP NotebookModel # hp 15-ay196nrWindows 10 Home7th Gen Intel Core i7-7500U1 TB Hard Drive8192 MB DDR4 SDRAM15.6 HD LED Display

I last asked the community for assistance with my touchpad not working and I am grateful for the repiles I received.  It might help others to know that I subsequently bought a replacement touchpad and began to replace the old which was not clicking physically but I found that it was simply jammed up with broken bits of plastice from the hinge base posts and other screw posts that had disintegrated.  I removed the bits and the old touchpad is now fine.  However, much worse is the realisation that the creaking base of the laptop which moves away from the top whenever the lid is closed is a much more serious problem.  I had been puting up with this previously but see that this is awful and is only going to get worse.  I could never transport it anywhere without risk.  It has never been out of my house since bought and has not been dropped or manhandled in any way.  It cost close to £1,000 and so I have been ultra careful with it.  Because of that cost i would now pay for it to be repaired so can anyone help me with the best place to have it reliably fixed please and at not too ridiculous a cost?  Thank you in anticipation!

@Nicole13, @Rick-SI have an HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15m-bp0xx Notebook and the left hinge is broken; which prevents the laptop from being operated (open/close) without potentially causing additional damage. I've noticed a large amount of people reporting this exact problem.  In addition, the broken hinge component caused the bottom-left corner of the touchscreen display to become separated from the laptop ""lid""/cover.   NOTE : This is the second notable hardware defect issue I've experienced with this laptop. Only 3 weeks after purchasing this laptop I contacted HP Customer Support regarding a ""grinding"" sound coming from my laptop. IT was identified by the HP tech as an installation defect with the fan hardware.     ""There are clearly major problems with HP's design and manufacturing of hinges.  After having the hinge break on my ENVY 15 Notebook this summer, HP repaired it. Just a few months later, it broke again (despite extremely careful use throughout the time that I used it).""https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinges-AGAIN/m-p/689281...

So today while using my HP envy 360 laptop the screen has randomly fallen off the left hinges and is very loose.  I was able to press it back in place temporarily, however whenever I move the screen it comes off the hinges again. I have had the laptop for about 2 years and unfortunately warranty is over, this is upsetting because I have made sure to take very good care of my laptop and this problem still occurred. I also did some research and it seems this problem is common for HP envy users.  What did you people who had a similar problem do?  Any recommendations are appreciated

Why does HP make it so hard to talk to someone? Is it because they are constantly getting complaints so they had to make it hard to call in? Can anybody please help me here?!?!

My laptop is just two years old so out of warrantee but one of the hinges has broken. I’ve never mishandled it and have always opened and closed the device as recommended. This does not seem fair wear. There is no number to ring for out of warrantee products. Has anyone had any joy with HP as it seems like a common problem with this model? I don’t consider it is fit for purpose if it only lasts 2 years.

I sent my laptop in because of the broken hinges, and after 2 months and numerous delays it finally came back to me, and instantly i noticed that the hinge that was supposed to be replaced looked like it was already starting to break again. I cannot afford to send it off for another 2 months to be fixed because i have finals in 2 weeks and all of my notes are on this computer. I have never dropped the laptop and i mostly keep it at home besides taking it to school with me 2 days a week and taking it with me to the library. The fact that i paid over $300 and went through hell to get it back because of the constant delays and the support team at HP giving me hardly any information gives me little to no hope that this issue will be resolved. Considering the amount of complaints for the exact same issue im surprised that HP hasnt recalled the laptops, or fixed the hinge problems for free. I can say that if these issues arent resolved i will never be purchasing a HP product again based on the poor customer service and poor product design. Other than the hinge problem i love my computer, but the amount i paid for it was not worth the trouble. If there is anything that someone from HP can do for me i would greatly appreciate it.

Hi - I wondered if anyone could help with this as I'm at a loss of where to go. One of our customers has a faulty ZBOOK 15 G5 Mobile Workstation.One day he tried to open the screen and one of the hinges seems to have broken.He's dropped the laptop off to us and we can see that apart from being worn in places, there is no damage (at all) to the laptop.However, support wont fix it as they say its physical damage.Its internal, and to be honest, its starting too look not too pretty because every time we open the screen, it gets worse. I've worked in IT support a long time and have seen this before a few times - it looks like the hinge has either seized up or broken. Having logged this (and originally agreeing the laptop is in good condition) HP support are now saying this is physical damage. In all honesty, the cost doesn't affect me as it would go to the customer, so its not about that - but the machine is in good working order and is not damaged. My problem is they said they won't fix it as there are no known faults with this device and they need multiple instances before they'll accept it.My argument is if I am the first person to have this, it doesn't mean its not happening - multiple instances start with the first occurance. So... I've asked if there is someone I can speak to that does have the power to authorise this and apart from being rather rude on the phone, the support agent said they would only raise it to customer relations again - but would not let me speak to them.I just think if I can speak to someone, I could get it sorted - I just need someone to actually speak to me. Has anyone else had this issue, and did you manage to get to speak to someone? Thanks for your help Jon

 My Envy 17's  left hinge has come adrift and is causing the case to separate.There are no loose plastic pieces in the case or fan issues yet.We are leaving the top open; it is no longer a portable laptop. Through searching I have learned this is a common and long time issue starting with prior laptops models.This premuim and expensive latop is just over 2 years old and has been kindly treated; never dropped.I have been a long time HP customer. Today I spent over 30 minutes & 2 phone calls with HP Techical and Customer service ultimately being 'dropped' both times during transfers. I'm hoping this forum's moderators will do better. Yes, the laptop is no longer under warranty but this is a long term well known design weakness.I expect to hear from HP with a  no-cost to me repair solution.Per HP's motto they are ""Here to keep you happy; And your PC, too"" I will provide updates to this issue.

Where/How can we get parts to fix/rebuild the cartridge holdown Clip Either the full assembly or just the hinge part ( the one with the broken off Stub) I've been canibalizing Others ( stripped gears from users pulling paper thru) to fix some but need more hinges. Simple design of a cutout or panel in the case as done for the Ctdg replament would have saved me 20min per. guess that doesnt add to the bottom line. Would have been a simple Alum or other metal cast for that part saved a lot of headaches.

Hi,The left hinge on my laptop is broken causing the bottom left corner to pop out of place, have read this is a common problem with this model which is appalling. I have taken care of this laptop since getting it in 2018 and the warranty has run out, never had a problem with the laptop during this time, never dropped or misused it since it has all my vital uni work. I am already back at uni and will really need this laptop due to all the online learning could not have broken at a worse time.  I do not wish to pay half of the price of what I brought this laptop for just to fix a manufacturing error. Please provide a good solution.

I purchase my Envy laptop back in 2014-February with Windows 8.1 Pro and have had a few issues since. The first issue is super long reboot times. The duration did shorten by a few minutes when I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, but it is still completely unusable for about 20 minutes. The CPU stays pegged at 100% and the only thing that seems to be running is System. I have tried disablng all extra programs from running at startup, yet the problem persists. Sometimes I will even have this issue if I dont use the machine for a week.  I have the I7-4700, 12 GB of RAM, and a 1TB 5400RPM drive. I have thought seriously about upgrading to an SSD with the fasted write times, but havent wanted to spend the money yet. Is there a setting or something that could be causing this issue? My second, and super frustrating issue, is that last week the hinge next to the power button has decided to seize up and has bulged out of the case, thus breaking the clips between the top and the bottom of the case. For now, I am just leaving the laptop in the open position as there is a lot of carnage going on with that side of the laptop when I try to close it. Is this a known issue and does HP have a fix for this?

Hey all - I've seen this problem popping up around the internet for many more than just myself, so want to crowd-source a solution if possible. The chassis of my HP Omen 17.3"" laptop is cracked. Completely broken through, actually. Right near the right hinge, there is a crack running from the edge of the chassis just above the charging port that runs through and into the speaker perforations. I take exceptional care of the computer and have only had it for nearly two years so can't fathom why this is happening. Has anyone found a viable DIY replaceable chassis for sale? I haven't been able to locate one and can't really give up my computer for any length of time as I use it for my job quite heavily. Let me know! Thanks everyone!

Last week my Spectre x360's battery was running low and it prompted me to plug it in to charge. I plugged in and the laptop was not charging. I tested the outlet and inspected the charger/port to see if there is damage.  Everything is in perfect condition, neither the laptop nor the charger have been dropped nor damaged. Called HP support and the laptop is one month out of warranty... Ordered another charger and the laptop still does not charge.  The LED next to the power button used to blink 3 times and the laptop would not boot up. Now the LED does not blink at all. Reading x360 support messages it looks like others have had the same issue and it has been a failed motherboard. Is this a known issue is there anything else I can do? Very dissapointed in this whole situation considering what I spent on the laptop and the timing of this issue.

I have the same problem with hp J6480. I have only 1 little plastic point broken off the right side hinge.  I can't understand why customers can't get parts for the hinge and put it on.  Guess hp is hoping to make more $ off its customers.  The hinge doesn't seem to be that difficult to replace.  Now it won't even print a test page.  This is sorry business that customers can't replace something simple.  If I buy another printer, it will likely be a different brand.

Purchased my high end HP Envy x360 Touchscreen only a few years ago.  Never been dropped, never abused.  Today I went to close it and the left hinge broke, immediately causing a sizable area of the lower left of the screen to shatter.  This is criminal for such a high quality HP laptop.  The laptop still sorta works but I can no longer reposition the screen (open or close) without risking additional damage to the screen.   The Touchscreen feature, however, no longer works at all.  After doing some quick Google searches, I was surprised and appalled to see all the similar complaints from other users.  And it appears HP is not accepting responsibility for a design defect and is expecting users to pick up the tab for this one.  If it would have just been a hinge failure, I could probably live with that.  But the fact that it broke the lower left portion of the screen, HP has just lost themselves a loyal and longtime customer.  I take very good care of everything I own.  I have always handled this laptop with great care.  Please don't tell me, HP, that this was caused by anything other than a failure in your design of these hinges.

HP 15t Defective hinge problemOptions ‎04-20-2016 08:14 AMFrom reading the posts in this forum I see that the hinge problem has affected the different models of the 15t, and it was a serious problem that could cause a catastrophic failure.All the problems reported date back a year ago or more.My question is if the current batch ofspecifically the Envy 15t still has the hinge problem. I am considering buying one and I am postponing it until I know the issue has been resolved.Any comment is appreciated, and thank you so much for your assisy=tance.

Hello,I have an HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15-cn0017tx.  After a very short search, it is clear I am not the only person with issues relating to the hinges on this series of laptop.  The laptop has not been dropped nor has it had a hard existence.  Literally 2 months out of warranty and not only has the hinge failed, in doing so, the flexing on opening and closing the laptop has now cracked the screen.This was not a cheap laptop and this will not be a cheap repair.Love any advice on next steps.--- minor update --- any assistance on the part number for the hinges greatly received.

Hello HP,
 
I am deeply concerned - I bought a 17"" HP envy but less than a year since
, the laptop is coming apart at the bottom near the Hinge for the screen to the left. I am afraid to open it because it makes a ""pop"" sound every time I open the screen.
 
God knows I have been extra careful with this laptop. Yopu will not find a scratch on it from bangs or things like that but am deeply scared of this 1200$ piece falling apart not even a year into my using it.
 
Can someone please advise where to repair this from?? I am based in Uganda but will be travelling to San Francisco and Los Angeles soon.
 
Please advise, am beginning to lose faith in the machine, and brand..

Hello all, In August of 2018, I purchased an HP Certified Refurbished HP ENVY 13-AD173CL. This was the first ""new"" computer I have ever purchased, but I wanted to make an investment that would last me through my years at University. A few months into using the device, I have begun to experience frame bending issues, as the laptop would not close properly. On its own accord, the screen has broken and the touchscreen stopped working, all while the laptop was within my padded backpack. Most recently, the back left of the device has split open, exposing what appears to be internal components. It also appears that plastic debris has been coming from within this hole. Being the second-largest purchase I have ever made to date, I have taken the greatest care and caution with this laptop. Upon doing some research, I have discovered that my issue is experienced by many other HP ENVY owners. I would like to know what steps I can take to repair or replace this device. Many thanks.

Hello all,I purchased an HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop about two and a half years ago (which means that sadly, yes, my laptop is out of its factory warranty), and after daily use through school and attempting to find work, the hinge has almost completely broken. I do not close the laptop anymore out of fear that the screen (or anything else, really) will break. I have taken the utmost care of this laptop--carrying it in its own bag, being as gentle as possible with it, and I have never dropped it or anything like that, and the hinge all of a sudden just made a loud noise upon closing the computer. This has been an issue for about a month, and now the bezel has started to peel away from the screen, which is worrying me even more. After some digging, it seems like this is a very, very common problem for this model, and that is absolutely outrageous.I am even more upset about this problem given that I had to send this computer back to HP as soon as I received it about three times before my original issue was correctly diagnosed and fixed. My original issue: upon receiving this computer, it would work for a handful of days, then the hard drive would corrupt itself, leading me to wipe the drive entirely and reinstall Windows many times. It took HP support around three different attempts to actually fix this. And when they finally sent it back with a working hard drive, one of the fans was making a loud grinding noise it had never made before, and I had to replace it on my own since I did not want to send the computer back for a fourth time. I was furious originally, but I was just glad to get my computer in time for school once it was finally fixed for good so my anger faded. But now that another issue has arisen, my anger from that situation is flooding back. After paying upwards of $1000 for a product, I should not be met with so many issues upon receiving it and after treating it like it's my baby for the last two years (I say two now instead of two and a half, since that's how long I've been using it as a daily driver, considering I had to send it back to HP so many times upon initially receiving it).I would love to talk to an HP Support representative regarding my laptop and getting this repaired, as I am not confident in handling this big of a repair on my own, and frankly, I should not have to if this is some kind of manufacturing defect, which it seems to be.I hope all of you reading this have been staying safe during COVID and continue to stay safe going forward. Have a great day, all.Zack

I know this will shock some of you, but the hinges on my laptop broke.  My 11 year old daughter saved her money for 2 YEARS to buy herself a laptop. She was thrilled when I finally told her she had enough money to go shopping. We went to Best Buy and settled on an HP. I've had HP products in the past with satisfactory results. She was so proud of her new computer and we went home to get it up and running. Within a week, the HD gave out. 1 WEEK! So I bought her a new SSD and installed it. That's ok, these are faster anyway. About 5 months after purchase, the old hinge gave out and the struggles began. The rest is a similar story to the thousands of others you'll find here and elsewhere online. I see there was a class action lawsuit against HP that they just threw some hush money at and ignored the actual problem. Bad business or just lazy? To greedy to spend a little extra for better quality materials? That's what I'm guessing. So I'm bypassing HP ""Support"" and fixing it myself. From what I've seen they just gouge people for repair costs anyway. Shameful. I will never buy an HP product as long as I live, and will steer everyone I can away from this company. Also, my daughter is going to grow up into a computer consumer for a long time into the future, and guess which company SHE will never buy from again! It breaks my heart to think about having to tell her that her prized possession is junk, so I won't. She doesn't deserve that heartache. But I will definitely ingrain into her memory to NEVER buy HP products. I fully expect the robot to answer me with the standard ""we're looking into it..."" or whatever blow off canned response they give on this board, if not them deleting this message to begin with. I just needed to vent and maybe help someone else from making a terrible mistake. Good luck to anyone who happens to read this.  I wonder how many complaints Best Buy has gotten over this? It would be a shame if a giant like them decided not to caryy HP anymore! Hmmm????

The left hinge on my (almost) 2 year old HP Envy 360 is failing. Has anyone had luck finding an independent repair company to fix the issue? I can not afford to lose my business computer- so want to find a way not to ship it. My work is time sensitive, and legal deadlines are not easily waivable.  It appears that hinge failure is a common and systemic problem. HP will you compensate for the cost of hiring someone to fix it?

So I originally had 1 hinge break on my laptop. The other side broke since that time since the screen was only half supprted during this ordeal. A quick online search shows this is not uncommon with this model. I contacted HP while still under warranty, emailed pictures as requested, and was told that this repair was approved to be covered under the warranty. Great I thought, until I was told that I could not do the repair myself and would have to ship it to a service center which would result in me not having my laptop for 3 weeks. Having purchased it to use for work in addition to pleasure, I could not be without use of my laptop for such a long period of time. During one of my first phone calls, I was told that I could purchase the parts if I choose to and they could be shipped to me. Even though this was approved under the warranty, the only way I could receive the parts and repair it myself, was to purchase them. They are covered under warranty and would not cost me anything if I shipped it out for 3 weeks, but if I wanted to repair it myself and have full use within the time it would take me to repair it (a couple hours at most),  I purchased the them. Quite a frustrating situation when there is no question to warranty coverage.After following up again later, and coming to terms with the fact that I may have to purchase parts covered under warranty, I am told that I cannot order the parts or even have the part numbers so I can find them elsewhere online. This is because they are not on their list of ""customer replaceable parts"". Prior to making my laptop purchase, I somehow ""mistakenly"" assumed that I could purchase parts needed to repair it or upgrade components. So now that I can't purchase the needed parts from HP and only an authorized store can make this request from their service center (who ""I'm not able to contact"", and the customer service rep supposedly is ""not authorized to either""), they can not even provide me with a part number so I can purchase these ""warranted parts"" with my own money and using my own time and labor to fix it.This is a short summary of my frustration over several phone calls, online chat, numerous transfers to other departments, and sudden dropped calls. Not really sure where to go at this point to fix my broken laptop that was approved to be covered under warranty unless I ship it somewhere for a few weeks. It is extremely dissappointing to me that there is no other solution to fix or even identify the parts I need to purchase.

Hopefully I can receive some help as well.  The arm screen hinges on my HP Envy m6 on both sides have completely removed themselves out of the bottom casing.  The laptop has not been dropped or slammed. The problem started small, but worsened over time from what I'm assuming is because of just opening and closing the laptop screen. Luckily my screen is still intact, but I cannot close my laptop completely.  I purchased this laptop some time ago, so it's well and out of warranty for sure, but I would like to inquire on information about an official repair. I have priced computer repair shops around me, but they seem to only offer temporary solutions, such as gluing the hinges back into the casing.  Because of this being a common problem amoungst Envy users, what solutions does HP offer to me with the computer's warranty being expired? I too, look forward to your response and thank you in advanced.R.

I have a HP 17-ca0000 Laptop PC.  It is several years old and no longer under warranty.  After using my computer with no issues for 2 years or so the plastic laptop cover started to separate apart near the right hinge. The right rear area would bulge up and close with difficulty, having to press down very firmly to completely close. Recently however, the lower right hinge appears to have broken completely?  The laptop does not close at all without really forcing it to close and appears that further damage might be caused by closing the laptop.  I have not dropped or had any other issues.  Does anyone have information about replacement parts (hinge, cover) for this laptop from HP or from a 3rd party vendor?

The left hinge has had a noisy snap when the computer was closed for some time. (I thought the case was warped from leaning my elbow on it.) But after the fan started rattling then quit working, I took the bottom panel off and discovered lots of small black plastic pieces, one of which had jammed the fan. The plastic pieces are from the hinge -- broken off from where the plastic has failed to hold the grommets. The hinge is so stiff it will barely move. The right hinge has some of the same damage as well.

Same issue here, and the hinge broke my screen. Please assist HP. What are my options? This issue is a manufacturing design flaw, and we, as your clients, should have received a product recall. My Laptop is just over one month out of warranty and probably would have failed earlier if I had used it more often. Please assist.

I have had a problem with the left hinge on my computer (purchased Dec. 2013) for at least a year or more. It wasn't a big deal, until I just yesterday took it to Best Buy's Geek Squad and the tech that tried to fix it made it worse. Now, the bottom panel is somewhat separated from the top panel and it doesn't click closed anymore. The tech told me something was broken and it was not fixable. It isn't under HP warranty anymore. Is this fixable or do I need to replace it?

I've owned this laptop about 9 months now. The hinge broke on one side 7 months after I bought it. Similar to a couple other threads I've seen, when I went to close it plastic fell out, some pieces inside broke and it made a rattling sound when I picked it up. I have not closed it since it broke, however the front plastic around the screen frame is now broken as well because the broken hinge is putting strain on the screen's seam (first picture).  I opened up the back of the laptop and found a loose screw in the hinge that I took out (second picture). The laptop is working wonderfully otherwise so I'm hoping to find some way to replace it without further damage. Only one side of the hinge is broken but with the wear on it so far I assume the other side is going to break pretty soon. I've removed the back, I just see no way to replace this easily or disassemble it safely.

The tray holding the paper is closed but the screen doesn't allow printing.  it just says to close the tray.  We pulled the tray completely out and it looks like a piece way at the back is broken off.  Suspect that there is a sensor that isn't being hit which will not allow the printer to proceed with printing, scanning, etc. etc. Is there a work around for this issue?

Hello, I have a Notebook 15 (product number 2PW30EA) which is 6 months out of warranty. Upon opening it this morning the left hand side hinge ceased at about 40 degrees, so I gently opened to full 90 degrees whilst supporting the hinge but I can see the hinge is broken. It is loose and in the same corner I can see that the frame has unclipped from the hinge bracket. I am unable to close the laptop which is ok whilst working from home but it makes travelling with it a no go. I called Currys P.C. world servicing department who were not helpful in terms of letting me know part costs. They told me I would be charged a labour fee but that the parts would be disclosed after I paid the labour and that the labour fee was not refundable should I choose not to go ahead with the parts. I am uncomfortable with paying an upfront fee without knowing the total cost. I have not mishandled or dropped my laptop and have taken such good care of it. Gutted it is 6 months out of warranty

I have a Hp envy x360 that I have been using for college only. I was using my laptop to write an essay, when I was closed it the left hinge snapped open and pieces fell out. I have not been able to use my laptop and I have a lot of online work. The laptop never fell or was it hit, neither is it chipped anywhere. It’s in perfect condition except for the hinge spontaneously opening. While doing my research I see that others have the same problem. My laptop is out of warranty and so when I called they told me it’s going to be $300 and up to fix an issue that’s their fault. I am in a bind because my classes are online and I can’t take my exams since I can’t move, open, close or use my laptop.

My laptop is just 2 months out of warranty although after reading other posts I don’t think this makes a difference! One of the hinges has snapped/broken and the screen is pulling away from the back lid whenever I open or close the laptop and am no longer able to open it completely (to tablet mode) in fear that it will get damaged further. Someone has suggested using a strong glue to hold it in place but I don’t feel I should need to do this when it is clearly a very common issue with these models.

When I opened my laptop this morning, there was a sudden crack of plastic snapping, the right hinge to my display broke, and a short wide screw fell out. Looking on these boards, it sounds like other people have experienced this issue as well. The warranty expired literally 11 days ago so I wasn't able to figure out how to contact support directly on this, and am just hoping I can get in touch with someone from HP support on here to help me look into this. Thank you.

The breakage has exposed wires and the inner hardware. I have seen from previous comments that this is a common issue due to cheap materials used and design flaws in the laptop.

I sent my laptop to be fixed because the hinge had broken. when I got it back  it was doing some weird stuff (either it double clicked all of the time, or I never could double click I forget) so I reinstalled the mouse driver  with the help of tech support which fixed that.Now it sometimes types backwards. it isnt all of the time, so it isnt some sort of setting that I opted into. The cursor has typing go to the left of it. It also (but not as often) will move the cursor so i end up typing in the middle of text that i already typed.Since I am not a touch typer I am somewhat slow and dont notice this initially because I am looking at the keyboard while I type, so retyping stuff has made me even slower. thanks

Hello,A few days ago, the right corner of my screen started coming apart from the casing. This is apparently a very common problem with these laptops. I take very good care of my laptop and have not dropped it at all - the hinge just broke seemingly out of nowhere.

Well this hing business is got me steamed up, I just broke a $300 screen because the hing decides to let go while stationary. I didn't notice this so of course when I try to fold it up it just crumbles. I been referring OTS buyers to HP since before most the current HP users where young but I'll not be doing this under recent management as I feel the company direction recently has been in decline.  So here I am stuck with a broken laptop just over the warranty that is iffy on cost to repair vrs buying new and I know if it's new it ain't gonna be no HP. Any helpful advice on replacement parts availability and cost or instruction is appreciated regardless.  I'd like to save my laptop even if it's not perfect, though for a computer they still want $1400 for I'll not do that ever again, and if HP had financed me I'd still be in better shape then the national chain that sold me the contract.

Hi HP team, I'd like to log that today when opening my HP Envy laptop, the hinge near the top right of the keyboard broke and opened up the base of my laptop. I'm very concerned about this. Unfortunately my warranty has run out but I did not expect this hardware failure to occur after only 1 year 3 months of purchasing a new laptop.  Having searched the forums, it appears to be a common problem. Could you let me know what I can do to get this fixed? Kind regards,Kerry

Hello, I am writing to check if the manufacturer's warranty will cover replacement of back lcd cover and left hinge for the HP Envy 360 Convertible laptop. The bottom left corner of the screen separates from the casing when opening/closing. Unable to close laptop without damaging screen. I have identified the hinge screws separated/broke away from the screw holes. This appears to be a common problem with these hinges and several persons have posted on this subject and appear to have HP reach out to resolve this. Please let me know if HP would have considered this damage due to a defective hinge.  Here are few of the other complaints I have seen from previous threads:1. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/td-p...2. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Envy-Left-Hinge-Broken/m-p/6979085... 3. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Hinge-Popped-Open/m-p/... 4. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-x360-15T-BP000-HINGE-I... 5. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...6. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-left-hinge-HP-ENVY-x...

Purchsed laptop from BestBuy in 2017 and both the right and left hinges have started to come loose. On the right side, the border around the screen has also stared to come loose. The laptop has never been dropped or been used in any way that should lead to this kind of damage and it has been a single year. I checked and complaints about hinges seem to be quite common... and the company isn't usually very helpful.

I have the seized screen hinge issue that so many others have complained about.  I see there is an entire thread about this issue.  The laptop was purchased in 2012.  It doesn't travel just sits on a desk and hasn't ever been abused or dropped.  Shortly after the warranty expired, I started having trouble with the left hinge.    Then the right hinge seized.  The problem has progressively gotten worse and the metal and plastic body of the computer is literally separating just from the weight of the screen while the laptop is open.  Fortunately, the screen still works.  I don't even dare shut it anymore for fear of what may happen, though.   After two years with this problem,  I finally decided to do some research and found that this is an obvious design defect with this HP model and a number of others.  It appears that others have had their laptop repaired even out of warranty.  I am very disappointed.   I am posting this in the hopes that someone can help me get this problem fixed through HP.  The computer is otherwise in good working order, but the screen hinge/separating body issue is a real problem and I had hoped to have this computer for another year or two. Very disappointed... Mr. Taqdeerullah

On 7/25/2018 I opened up my HP Envy x 360 laptop and heard a loud crack. When I looked at it, I noticed the left hinge had broken. I bought my laptop on 11/24/2017 with a one year warranty, so I contacted HP through chat. They told me they would send me a box and that I would ship it back to them for repair. On 7/26/2018 I shipped my laptop out to HP.
 
On 8/13/18, I got a call from an HP service center representative. She informed me that they would not repair my laptop because the damage was not covered by my warranty. I asked the rep how it was not covered and she insisted that I must've dropped the laptop or set something on top of the laptop to cause damage to it. I NEVER dropped, nor set anything on top of my laptop. I never even moved my laptop because it is expensive! I always kept it in the same spot on my desk, but the rep insisted that I had to've caused the damage. She told me I could either pay them to fix it (for a cost of over $300) or they would send it back to me. So I told her to send it back to me. We hung up the phone and I did some research...
 
Lo and behold, I am not the only person to have this issue. When I searched HP Envy x360 laptop hinge problem I found TONS of reviews that this had happened to other people.

I called HP back to see what my options were. I explained my situation and I was transferred to a supervisor. The supervisor apologized to me and explained that when my laptop arrived at the service center that they ran diagnostics on it and found that the screen was broken. Now wait a minute, I sent my laptop in for the broken hinge. There was nothing wrong with the screen when I sent it in. He said that it was possible the screen could've been damaged in transit. But how is that my fault? It isn't. But too bad. Regardless, the screen, as they claim, is broken. They cannot fix the hinge without fixing the screen as well. So what are my options? The rep told me I can wait to receive my laptop back and when I receive it I can call back with my case number and they can make a corporate case.
 
Today, on 8/15/18, I received my laptop back. I opened it up, plugged it in, and turned it on. The screen does not look to be damaged to me (picture included). If there is any damage, it is clearly insignificant.

And here is a picture of where the hinge is broken...
Broken left hinge on my HP Envy x360
As you can see, the cheap plastic that the screws were attached to, snapped. So anyhow, I contacted HP again and explained I have received my laptop back and the screen looks fine. The man I spoke to (Monty, not sure what department exactly because I was transferred 3 times) told me AGAIN that there was nothing I could do but pay them to fix it because it was my fault it broke. I told him about the other rep saying I can make a corporate case and Monty told me that since my laptop already went through the service center there would be nothing corporate could do. I explained to Monty that I was very upset by all this because it is not my fault that the laptop broke and I shouldn't have to pay over $300 to fix something I didn't break. He still insisted there was nothing else they could do. I brought up the fact that other people have had the same issue, and he told me ""yes well those people must've done the same thing as you"" and by that he means they must've dropped or set something on their laptop too.
 
Back in November 2008 HP recalled the hinges but only for 6 months, so that anyone who had issues after the deadline had to suffer. Obviously, this has been a problem for a long time and HP doesn't care to fix it. Maybe I should [edit]. I will NEVER buy another HP or recommend them to anyone.

Hello, This morning, when I opened my laptop to do my homework, the left hinge broke loose and the side of the laptop screen opened. This is really disappointing for me since I had this exact problem a year ago with the same laptop and I had to get it fixed under the manufacturer warranty. I am usually very careful with my laptop since I spent a lot of money on it. Unfortunately, my warranty expired a year ago, but I hope that HP can help. I'm a student so I don't have a lot of money for repairs. Thanks.

I opened the laptop just like any other day - and heard a CRACK. The top of the laptop stopped about halfway open. When I turned the laptop around/over the plastic cover was cracked and what looks like a hinge (and other internal parts) are revealed. When closing the laptop again, it no longer lines up. It does not close properly, Now each time when it is opened, there is a crack. The shell is broken. Of course, we have had the laptop for just over a year, so no warranty, and I have had no luck speaking with a live agent. This has to be cause by an ineffective mechanical part. I have owned many laptops and never had any issues with any hinges.  (We did see an additional post about the exact same issue with the same model, less than a year old)UPDATE: Now the laptop will no longer stay open on its own. Now the top of the laptop no longer lines up but it has become detached from the base. We went with an HP over other brand based on reputation but are extremely disappointed that a laptop that is only one year old would be mechanically defective, especially at this price point!

In doing many searches, I see this is a common problem and a design flaw  with this laptop. I went to a local repair place and they say it would cost approx $300.00 to fix it!  I am still making payments on this computer.This is a rediculous situation especially with it being a design flaw and not my mishandeling!  What will you do about this issue?

hi I was wondering if (1) anyone has had the same problem with their hp envy hinge? opened it one day and heard a crack, when I checked, I realised that the hinge had popped out of the casing but can be popped back in again, but it  is starting to put Pressure on the screen which causes it to pop out of the bezel. there was NO DROPPING OR ANYTHING SAT ON IT as has been implied by hp. as it was only a month out of warranty I felt that this was unacceptable for a year old laptop which has been well looked after, so i contacted hp. after going from one person to another, someone finally got in touch with  me about repairing it, which I was happy for them to do, until they quoted me £320 just to fix a problem that has resulted because of a inferior product so I said under trading standards rights this should never have happened and should never happen to a product under 5 years old, never mind a year old one! all I got was a supposed discount so I asked to speak to the manager, and was informed that the manager of the customer service department of hp could not speak to customers and there was nothing else they could do, but they would speak to the manager and be back in touch, never heard from them again, and found out my case has now been closed!!! absolutely fuming! so (2)  my only option now is to either pay the earth for someone to fix my hinge, or write a letter of complaint to hp and open a case with citizens advice. please could someone give me the address to send a letter to hp, and hp, could someone please fix my hinge without charging the earth for it!!!!

So I was looking into this issue and it looks like it is a common problem. The left hinge on my laptop is broken so when I open it the screen pops out on the left side. Since this is such a common issue why is HP not doing anything about it? What have you guys done to get help for it? This computer repair company quoted me $300-$400 which is ridiculous to me because I know parts don’t cost that much.. any advice?

Similar to another post in this forum - we purchased the above computer for my daughter.  And then the lcd started to get difficult to open and finally the hinge broke on the left side.  Currently its taped together in the open position and can not be closed.  We also purchased it at CostcoWe are out of warranty and really just looking to see how we can replace this.  The computer itself is phenomenal and very happy with it.  Its going to get very difficult to take it to school in August if the screen is open and I would like to avoid purchasing a new computer.Thank you,

Hello,The right hinge on my HP ENVY x360 Laptop - 15z-ee000  is broken.  I’ve had this laptop just a little over a year.  The laptop was never dropped, and yet, the hinge just broke by itself.  Checking the forum, I see that this is a design flaw from HP.  Very disappointed the HP don’t stand behind their products and provide fixed without charging a lot of money.  This laptop costs more than 1k, and yet it broke in less than 1.5 year.  Very disappointed customer in HP service.  Safe to say this will be my last HP product.

Hi All,  I have an HP envy x360. It’s approximately 18 months old (so out of warranty). This week the casing around the screen separated, and it appears that the hinge has separated from the case behind the screen. I can see the screws still in the hinge, so I’m pretty sure that the mounts have separated from the casing. I like this laptop, but this is clearly a design issue. You have a pivoting lever that isn’t securely anchored to deal with the basic function of opening and closing that comes with a laptop, let alone converting it to its tablet function.  Based on the number of complaints about this exact issue that I’m seeing on this forum alone, I’m not the only person having this issue. I’m also seeing a lot of complaints that HP’s solutions have been somewhat all over the place. Does anyone know if there has been a more streamlined solution to this, or am I going to have to navigate this gauntlet? Thanks in advance.

On 07/03, I went to open my laptop and heard a loud crack on the left of the laptop, as I opened it I noticed the screen was detaching from the case around where the hinge holds it together. I'm not sure if this is a hinge issue or something else. Despite not even using the 360 function often (probably once a year) nor dropping or placing any weight on the laptop, I was surprised this happened. Having done a quick search on the forum/Google, it appears to be a common issue. I did purchase my laptop in Mar-2017, so I understand it has been a while, however, this is not what you would expect from a laptop that has had minimal use (it is my personal laptop, I use my work laptop daily).   I contacted HP and was initially quoted  between £2-300 to fix this, I'm not sure why HP are charging such an excessive fee for what may be a little hinge - the screen is perfect (no cracks, no marks). I spoke to a HP member of staff who suggested the fault may have been caused by damage and as it is no longer in warranty I am expected to pay for the repair.  Here are some links to suggest it is clearly not my fault, and it appears to be a manufacturing fault:1. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/td-p...2. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p... 3. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-x360-broken-left-hinge/... 4. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Hinge-Broken/td-p... 5. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-on-HP-Envy-x360/t...  I can go on, but it's clear this is a common issue.10-03 I received (and missed) a call back today from a supervisor, I called back to be told I can't speak to them directly but I would have to pay for the cost. This is extremely disappointing, owning 4 HP laptops (2 Envy, 2 Elitebook) in my household already with my most recent purchase just in Nov-20, I was expecting better service by staff. This has left me with a sour taste, having been a long term HP customer, this sadly may be my last purchase. I would be interested to know what advice others give to get this issue resolved? Of course, I do not want to pay as firstly it appears to be a manufacturing fault, and secondly we in the UK have 6 years cover for electrical goods (Consumer Rights Act 2015), and am surprised by HP's stance on the matter.

Hello, I have had my HP Envy for about three years now,  and when I just opened it I found a small black piece had broken off and that the left hinge is popping. I am super careful with my laptop, so I'm not quite sure how this happened. I would really appreciate assistance with this, since I am now nervous when it comes time to shut it after each session, and I do not want to bend the screen back too far in fear of it breaking off completely. I do not want my laptop to be further damaged. Thank you!

I purchased a $1100 envy360 in 2018. The laptop is now two years old so it’s a year out of warranty. I was using it last night and the left side hinge broke from the inside out. I called hp and they said because it’s out of warranty I would have to pay $500 to have it fixed which would take over a month. I am a college student I don’t have $500 or a month to get my laptop fixed. I told the person on the phone that tons of other people have this same issue so it’s obviously a quality issue. I have NEVER dropped it. I’m so disappointed that HP won’t stand behind their products and do the right thing and fix it for free. The laptop should last longer than two years before it starts to fall apart. I’ve asked them to have a manager call me.

Hi HP Support community. I really need some help. I have a brand new HP laptop. I got it on January 3rd, 2021. The hinge of this computer is now broken, it did not happen by accident, but happened randomly when I tried to open my Laptop. I have read several articles here from different users mentioning the same has happened to them. I have a global warranty that is still valid and would like to apply. I bought the laptop in India but currently am in Mexico. I reached out to an official service center here and they provided me an email to reach out to in order to get my warranty availed. I wrote them 5 emails and got no response. It makes no sense for me to pay 1/4 the price of my laptop to get it repaired for the damage I did not cause! Please help me avail my warranty and I will be forever grateful to HP!

I have a brand new HP laptop. I got it on January 3rd 2021. The computer has always been maintained really well. I was working on my laptop yesterday evening and everything was absolutely fine. Today morning I wake up to start work and open the laptop and hear this awful cracking and popping noise and the right side hinge is completely off with the bottom of the right side screen cracking. Now I have bought this really expensive laptop and i have kept it really well, so I'm really unsure why this could have happened. I purchased this laptop in India, but I am now living in Mexico city, Mexico. I reached out to the HP chat support and she said that my laptop is not registered in my region or the latin America region, which is very weird because when I type in My serial number I am able to find my warranty which says it is a global warranty and it's valid until January 2022. I sent her a pdf version of the guarantee and she transferred my chat support, and basically I could avail nothing.  I really would appreciate it if someone could help me with this because it's a beautiful laptop and it's so heartbreaking to have it broken. I have read through this community that this is a problem many have faced and have been able to find better support here on these forums! Thanks!

Help! I have an HP laptop that is less than two years old. It has been used very lightly and mostly sits open on my home desk.  Yesterday I closed it to take it to an appointment and when I opened it again and tried to adjust it the screen cracked in the lower left corner. When I looked closer I saw that the left hinge had broken and moved so that it got caught under the edge of the screen shattering it. It appears from other messages on this forum that this is a common failure.  How do I get help for this issue. I cannot afford $300 for a repair or $750+ for a new laptop. This seems to be a bad design as my laptop has not been dropped or abused in any way.

I have purchased two 17"" laptops.  The first had a left hinge that gave way.. Duct tape was a short term fix.The second I purchased with an apparent better hinge reinforced all the way across the back of the laptop.The right hinge gave way.  I was fooled in thinking HP corrected a flawed design.  I question the ethics or lack of same when I peruse customer complaints where no support is given by HP.  I am confident that the breakage is not the fault of the users.

Hi guys I have a HP Envy x360 15t-BPOOO.   Yesterday I noticed that the right hinge on my laptop has become loose and the bottom part of the screen becomes dislodged from the casing when I try and open/close it. I take very good care of this laptop and have never dropped it or anything. This happened completely out of the blue.  The laptop/screen are working fine but after some research it seems like this is a known manufacturing defect in the HP Envy models and there have been hundreds of posts about it. Examples below:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Envy-Left-Hinge-Broken/m-p/6979085...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Hinge-Popped-Open/m-p/... The laptop is less than 2 years old and is unfortunately out of warrantee. Really don't want it to get to a point where the entire screen unattaches from the casing. What options do I have to get this fixed?

Hi! I very recently got my HP Envy laptop back from a service repair (audio had died completely). When it was returned I noticed a dent on the top of the screen but it didn't impact the computer's performance so I wasn't too concerned. Yesterday when I was opening the laptop the right hinge attaching the screen to the keyboard snapped. Based on just a bit of googling it is clear this is a common issue - and that HP will do just about anything to deflect blame for a poorly designed piece, i.e. refusing service because the laptop may have been dropped. Well, what am I supposed to do? I did not drop or damage this laptop - it appears it was during a previous warranty repair or within shipment back. I'm absolutely certain if I try to make a warranty claim now that I will be denied. Absolutely absurd. I liked this laptop but these experiences are just ensuring I'm never buying HP again. I haven't even had this thing a year and it's been inoperable about half that time due to warranty issues

Like the 7000+ (and counting) HP users writing to call attention to your flawed design, my hinge is broken, too. I purchased this machine on 15 September 2017 and it sat on my desk, never dropped, damaged, or abused, used only casually for household management and occasionally working from home. As is the case with most of the others, the plastic has disintegrated where the hinges are screwed in and the right display hinge arm is snapped. I cannot safely close my machine without risking further damage to the bezel or my display. Thankfully, the LCD wasn't damaged. Only now, I can't even close the lid without destroying it.  There are countless replacement tutorials - including HP's own YouTube channel showing how to replace a broken hinge - and it's such a involved process, I know I'm not the only one who doesn't feel like a DIY replacement is worth the risk involved with disassembling the entire notebook. And yet...the quoted cost of the repair is more than the whole machine. What a joke. This is literally the worst computer I've ever owned. The processor is failing already, causing it to reboot itself constantly. It will not shut down or hibernate. But this is beyond ridiculous. There is no scenario I can imagine where a piece of the computer - the hinge! The part that MAKES it a NOTEBOOK COMPUTER! - should just snap in only two and a half years - that's two and a half years of being used three times a week, at most. That's 390 days. I opened and closed my notebook less than 400 times.  Maybe if I had used it more, it would have broken in the first year and HP would have honored its warranty. This is HP's design flaw experienced by nearly everyone unfortunate enough to have purchased an HP notebook.  I am furious. This is simply unacceptable. Your products are trash and I will never buy anything made by HP ever again, and I'll make sure to tell everyone I know to do the same.

I had bought a new HP envy laptop around 1.5 years ago and a week ago, the bottom right hinge of my laptop had broken, causing the screen to pop out without any misuse. In addition, 2 months after initially purchasing this laptop, it began having audio issues where sound will randomly be muted and when I closed my laptop, it never automatically went to sleep. I have dealt with a plethora of problems from this brand new laptop but this recent issue is completely unacceptable. Now I cannot use my laptop or move the screen around or it may break the screen even though I have never dropped it, rarely used it in tablet mode and I have taken very good care of it. It is incredibly disappointing that such an expensive piece of technology has such a huge design flaw that won't even allow for use of over 1.5 years. Looking at this forum it looks like this is a very common problem that HP has not solved and instead continues to disappoint users. I had contacted customer service and they did not provide any help and said it would take $400+ to fix which is ridiculous when this is clearly caused by a design flaw. Has anyone had any success dealing with a similar issue? After giving HP one try using their technology, I will never buy another HP product again and strongly discourage anyone purchase their poor quality products.

I have had my HP Laptop 17-by1xxx for not even 2 years and the laptop base and top cover are already separating. I have to be very careful when I open it. It is hard to open and feels like the hinges are about to break. Also, I can hear rattling like there are likely plastic pieces broken. I would really expect an HP laptop to last more than 16 months. It seems to be a common problem... I have looked at different forums and have seen many complaints for this same issue. What are my options?

I've had my pavilion gaming laptop for about a year and a few months. But one day after work I went to close my laptop to hear some plastic cracking/breaking sounds. Opening it back up and closing it again, the cracking sounds continued and some tiny screws fell out of the hinge corner that is cracking open. It looks like screws connecting the metal hinge to the screen has broken from their mounts and when closing the screen the hinge is cracking the plastic open. I've left the screen in a permanent open position to try to limit the damage, but when the screen is closed it's crooked. I'm very afraid it will cause screen to break or cause even worse damage. Does anyone have any experience with this issue and fixing it? I'm unfortunately out of warranty by a few months.

If you start looking a lot of people have the same problem with the hinges causing breaking screens. Avoid closing the lap top as much as possible. My problem was after the warrenty but HP are refusing to admit that this is a design fault despite so many people having the same problem. In fact when I reported the problem in the summer, hp said that they was not aware of this problem. Instead of the computer bag that they offered me I asked them to ensure that my problem was recorded in the records in case others have the same problem. Our screen has now got so much worse so I will be contacting them again. I am currently collating a list of others that are experiencing the same problem so they can not tell me the problem does not exist. Best of luck that it will get sorted for you.

Was just wondering how many out there have had the hinge broke on their 360 and its now cracking the screen. Ours started to break when the laptop was two years old and we didn't even use the 360 function. I am convinced this is a design fault as we looked after the laptop very well but HP do not agree and are refusing to fix which I do not agree with at all. Shameful as the laptop was expensive too. I have seen others complain about the same problem and each time it is the left hinge like ours. Therefore I would be really interested in hearing if there is anyone else. I have asked for my complaint to be logged so if others start getting the same problem. I also use a cheap HP at work and it feels so much stronger.

Several months ago we noticed the left hinge was broken and slowly it cracked the screen which is gradually getting worse and the screen is open somewhat on the left.

Today, I tried to close my laptop but I felt a lot of resistance coming from the left hinge. Whenever I try and push it shut, I can feel cracking and can't push any further without breaking something. I have had this laptop for 3 years now and I haven't experienced any problems, other than this current one. I can push it back, and flip it into tablet mode.

HiI need some advice please. The left hinge on my laptop has broken. I contacted hp and arranged to return it. I have an extended warranty on it which is still current. I was advised that this was indeed covered by the warranty.HP have received it and are saying there is ""physical damages"" which I assume means they think I have dropped it. I have never dropped it and am disgusted that they are trying to get out of repairing it under warranty.I was advised by their own agent to shut it flat in preparation for sending it away. I expressed my doubt over this as i was concerned that forcing it shut would damage it further. I did however shut it extremely carefully and the plastic cover of the hinge popped off. I clipped it back in place and sent it away.A simple internet search and their own forum is littered with people having a problem with the left hinge breaking. I can only assume its a design fault, shoddy workmanship or shoddy components. I need to know how to proceed as i do not want to pay £200 for a repair that is their fault and its still under warranty. Has anyone else had similar and how did you resolve it?

Barely use my laptop and yesterday when I went to open it I heard a crack…screen popped off on the left corner or the laptop. Seems like the pin in the hinge is broken and that it is a common defect. Of course, it happened shortly after warranty has expired. From reading other issues, seems like it is a purposely placed problem. My question is, does anyone have a fix for this that won’t break the pockets? Wouldn’t of thought I would have to fix a new laptop that I spent a few thousand on in less than 1.5 years

I've owned my 15"" envy ultrabook for 6 years now. I love it, still works like a charm. Unfortunately a year and some month's into my purchase the left hinge snapped. I contacted HP and all they offer was an outrageously expensive repair. Ive repaired this same issue 4 times now. Last night the snapped off again. 5th time. After searching this community I am completely amazed at the inattention HP has given to this manufacturer defect. I've read HP is offering a coupon. For what purpose? The problem continues to persist. User reports are starting to trickle in for hinge issues on 2018 Envy and Spectre laptops. I don't know what to do anymore...

I purchased my HP Envy x360 laptop in September 2021 and have taken extremely good care of it yet today just from opening my screen the hinge on the right broke and a screw fell out. The screen works but I obviously can't risk using the laptop in its current state. From looking at this forum its clear this is a common issue with this line.Despite still being under manafacturer's warranty, HP Customer Support has been absolutely useless, first saying they don't have support in my current country of residence (Pakistan), waffling if the repair can be done in the U.S where I purchased the laptop from or saying it's not covered. My last HP laptop I used for 5 years sans issue and for this new one to have such a major manufacturing defect within a few months is pathetic and making me reconsider ever owning another laptop from them. Pictures of the damage.

About 2 weeks ago i noticed that the right hinge of my laptop was loose and until now its just after getting worse, the bezel is coming off, the other hinge also came off so the  screen is disconnected from the keyboard (although i can still use it), and just recently there is a thick, black vertical line on the left side of the screen with blue and purple lines through it which also partially go away if i put pressure on it . I was wondering what would a good estimate for the fixing price be or would it be better to just get a new laptop. I'm sorta disappointed as i purchased this not too long ago in October but i guess there isn't much to be done now.  Any Help will be appreciated, Thanks! Product Name = HP Pavilion Laptop 14-ce0xxxPurchased from: Currys PC World

Hi all.  I know there have been numerous issues with the HP Envy line with broken hinges.  I have the HP Envy x360 15t.  Left hinge is broken.  Screen is not cracked as of yet.  I am just trying to figure out if it is just the top cover I need to purchase or if there is another part.  The silver plastic piece on the front bezel to the left of the hinge is loose/broken as well.  See pics. If you buy a new top cover, is that part of it, or do you have to purchase a whole new screen if that front lower bezel piece is broken? If so, can any assist with what parts to purchase? HP rep:  This is a question to others users in the community, not to HP itself.  From the number of hinge issues, it is not something you all have addressed in any reasonable manner, and from what I have seen,  charge a fortune to repair if no longer under warranty (which mine is not).  No need for an HP rep to reply.

My left hinge just broke, also.  I bought this computer around Christmas in 2016.  I never use it as a tablet, and have never dropped it.  In fact, it's used mainly like a desktop so I just close the lid at the end of the day and open it in the morning.  On this morning I heard a crunching sound and a snap then saw that the bottom left of the screen had seperated and the keyboard didn't work.  I tweaked the screen a little trying to get it back together and the keyboard came back to life.
 
I've owned maybe half a dozen HP computers over the years (my wife even worked for HP until her retirement) and I've never had a problem.  It seems that HP is not addressing this issue which is clearly a Quality Control problem.  If it's not addressed with a recall I may have to find a diffrent brand in the future.

To Whom It May Concern: I bought an HP Notebook 17-by0053cl new at COSCO on April of 2018, had it for almost two years now, one of the hinges snapped about 3 months ago, I was being careful trying not to damage it more then what it was, but now the other side just broke as well, the back of the casing in the corners pops every time I open or close the laptop, I have to press the corners to close it back in place, it creates a big gap on the laptop everytime I close it, because of this issue the laptop now has cracks near the hinges, the warranty only covered the device for one year, I dont have the money to fix it nor to replace it, I am afraid that it will be a matter of time before I wont be able to use it anymore.Before I bought this laptop, I was given an HP laptop which lasted me for a few years, then I bought an HP Envy that I enjoyed, unfortunately I had the same problem with the hinges within 2 years, I had to send it to HP which they fixed with no problems at all, I was pleased with their service, that is why I did not hesitate to buy another HP laptop when it was time to upgrade, well here I am again with the same problem. Now my laptop is falling apart, I'm afraid that It will be a matter of time before I wont be able to use it anymore. I am disappointed at how fragile this last 2 laptops have been, I don't mean that they should last forever but at least no less then 2 years. Is there anything that I can do so I can get my laptop fixed? Thank you in advance.

This morning I opened the lid to my 5 month laptop (bought 2nd of February) only for it to break apart. The right hinge came off and the screen is hanging on that side. I never thought that would be an issue with a £1000 laptop but I did a small search in this forum and apparently far too many people had the same issue. And down with the same route...phonecalls, pictures, emails just to prove that it isn't your fault rather a poor engineering choice of material. Apparently it also depends strongly on whom you're going to end up talking to within the customer service as some people were more favored than others who have been struggling with customer service only to be accussed that it was their mistake. That they decided to waste £1000 by playing frisbee with the laptop. I strongly hope that I don't get such an experience but I will be updating this thread with all my experience from customer service with every little detail. So far they asked for as many pictures and I have sent them. Tomorrow I expect a phonecall.I should also mention that this laptop came with a stuck pixel! I tolerated it as I didn't want to get involved with phonecalls with customer service and because I really needed my laptop for work. Let's see what assistance hp will provide.

Hello,    I am the original owner of a HP 4000N.  It has been sitting about 2 years unused.  I went to use it and got some kind of error that I did not record.  Went to pull the towner out and it felt stuck.  So I pulled harder, the toner came out but dumped toner all over the inside.  Ordered ne cartridge.  Cleaned up the toner inside quite a bit,  Put in new toner cartridge went to ready, Yay I thought. Only prints blank pages, actually I guess that's not really printing.  Removed ethernet from printer, shut down, removed ethernet interface, turned on, went to ready.  Pushed the printer engine test button and am getting blank pages. What's next?

I went to open my laptop like any normal day, and when I opened it the hinge obviously stuck thus cracking the bottom right of t the screen after hours with customer service both online and over the phone I was told its my fault, my laptop was purchased september 2020 its december 2020, they said its not covered by warranty because I broke it by opening the laptop.  This is absolutely insane, after climbing the ladder to a supervisor they said they best they would do is take 20 percent off the 600 bill to fix the screen, I said, no I didn't do this, they said i could send it in and if the tech can see the hinge being broken caused the screen they would fix it for free, but I have a strong feeling they are going to somehow make it my fault.  I am now waiting for a box to arrive, I also stated that when I close the laptop it will break further and for them to note that, they said they did but again, I am not holding my breath, How can an issue that has been happening for 3 or more years with these hinges not be addressed also How can I be made at fault for this.  I want this to be taken care of as it should under a manufacture defect that cause the issue, I have finals in a week and no laptop with my work to take this on, I will go out of my way to tell this story and being a student with disabilities it also makes it even more pathetic they place blame on me for their issue.  What is the solution?  Any suggestions>?

My laptop casing broke off (he said it was the clip that broke off) and I brought it to a repair store and they said I’d have to send it to hp but I can’t find anywhere to do that. The contact us button isn’t even a link I’ve been at it for the past two hours. I just want to know how much it would cost to send it in and replace the case.

Today when I opened my laptop I heard a noise and some small pieces of plastic fell out of my laptop. I noticed that my right hinge was broken and one of the screws was missing. I did not drop or hit my laptop or anything so I was confused as to why my hinge is now broken. After searching my issue online I have found that this has been a common issue with HP and that their customer service is not very helpful and lies and says that this is not a common issue. Unfortunately my warranty expired so I don’t know what to do about this issue. I haven’t even had this laptop for 2 years so I don’t know why it is breaking this early for being such an expensive laptop. Any advice on how I should go about getting the hinge fixed without having to pay a lot since this seems like this is an HP issue not a user issue.

Hi, So one day i went to move my laptop screen and heard a loud crack. a screw had gotten lose in the screen half of my laptop and got caught, causing the bottom left corner of my screen to crack and seperate from the back. a tiny screw fell out. Later the top screen completely came off the left hinge. It can still stand up but its fragile. I turned off the touch screen because it was glitchy.  Now i have a broken and cracked screen and a huge gap in the back. Everything else works but its so fragile. I'm not sure if i should try to get it fixed and where, or if i should just get another laptop. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!Jenelle

I bought this laptop last year, but I didn't start using it until February 2019 - so it's had just 8 months use.  Shocked to see on the HP forum that so many other HP laptops have the same problem that I discovered last week: the left hand hinge is faulty, meaning I cannot open or close the laptop as it doesn't align properly, and that the casing and screen frame are all pulling apart.  The laptop hasn't been dropped or misused in any way, I am 58 years old and take care of my belongings and there are no children pulling it around.  HP: where do I stand please as surely this must be a production or manufacturing fault?  Very, very disappointed.

Hi, I've tried to reach out to HP support on WhatsApp but gets no reply except for the automatic replies that it is the official HP support... I don't know if this is the only or correct way to reach HP support but I hope to get help or guidance.The laptop was bought from HP Sweden in October 2019 meaning it's within the by law stipulated 2 year warranty and the purchase also includes a 3 years service period (with free pick up and return). The issue is related to the hinge for the display and the plastic around being broken making it difficult to open and close the laptop. We've used it very carefully on a table or on the lap sitting in the sofa, so we were very surprised when the problem occured. As advised here above, I searched for hinge issues: now I'm even more concerned as these issues don't seem to be that rare and that it's linked to a weak design but still not all get adequate help (or a forced to pay for repair). Thanks in advance,Britta

It seems I've also fallen victim to the HP Envy broken hinge issue that many other posters have mentioned. Mine is still under warranty which you'd think would be an easy repair to organise. Unfortunately not. Support in my region is not available in English and try as I might with the support chat, I'm going round in circles trying to get them to understand the problem enough to generate a repair code to get it started.  Is this normal for HP support to be not that supportive?

I have had my laptop for less than two years and last night the left (when the laptop is open and facing you) hinge suddenly clicked and broke. It is now stuck open. The laptop is working but if I make a slight move to the screen to close it, the screen looks like it will rip away from the casing.It looks like this is a problem with the Envy model experienced by other users. I will contact HP support tomorrow but it is out of warranty. Does anyone know how to fix or repair this?

I bought this as a refurb, new with warranty early in the COVID pandemic.  The HP info shows the warranty expired before I even bought it! Or nearly so. When you open the screen, the bottom edge protrudes farther down than the base--causing the whole laptop to lift up, breaking the plastic where the hinge screws into the base.  Now the upper left corner of the keyboard and palm rest assembly lift up out of the bottom case assembly and have cracked the bottom case assembly around the ethernet opening.  There are many online videos about this problem, most showing how to do a teardown and super glue the plastic screw anchors and brass inserts. I have had other HP laptops and never had this problem.  I wonder if, because it was a refurb, the prior owner had dropped it or abused it somehow.  I am very careful with my equipment.  If it broke during my use, it was clearly a design or manufacturing defect. Replacing the bottom case assembly requires  removing everything.  The part itself is not so expensive, but there is a lot of work involved.  HP should supply an improved case and pay for having everything professionally moved to the new case. What is HP doing about this problem?

Hello, I purchased my laptop in July 2020. The hinges have become very stiff all of a sudden and the screen makes an uncomfortable cracking sound when opening. I am afraid something is going to give. Will this be covered under the warranty as it is not technically broken yet? Or is there something I can lubricate the hinges with? I purchased this because the hinges seemed sturdier. The hinges on an  Acer laptop I purchased exploded big time before I had had that year. Not too pleased.

I never had anything happen like this with any of my previous laptops. My Envy should have lasted longer than 3.5 years. This is my work laptop and I really like this model. I haven't gotten a quote from Best Buy where I purchased it from yet. I would at least like to be able to confidently open and close the lid again and not worry that I am causing more damage. Is there any way HP can please help and provide a solutio n so I can get my Envy back working as normal again. ThanksLaPeriall

The second of three options was to post on Community (which is this), while the third option was to drive to uBreakiFix, which I did and was turned away because they ""don't service hinges.""

My HP 17 has a broken hinge. It happened under warranty, so HP customer service sent a shipping box to me to send to their repair facility. Based in what the case tracking page said, I expected it back in about a week. About 3 days after the date passed, there was still no update to the case tracking and no explanation for the delay. So, I contacted customer service again. After some checking, the representative I was chatting with told me the problem is in getting parts. It was about 4 days after that call that the case tracking screen finally updated with a date I can expect my laptop back: February 20. That is 6 weeks after they got this from me.Am I to expect this as normal for a repair like this? Isn't there some way HP can inform customers about what is happening with a delay? Are they always going to have these problems with hinges on laptops? It seems to be a recurring topic here.

HInge has broken which has distorted case and cracked screen when lid was closed.   Laptop is well cared for and has not been travelling for obvious reasons.  Reading the forum this seems to be a common problem.  Is there a solution from HP ?

The hinge on this laptop broke previously after making creaking and cracking noises and the screen started to separate from the bezel.I went through HP to have this repaired and now less than a year later the hinge seems to be breaking again. I am tired of this persistent issue and it seems to be very common with these laptops. It is creaking again and I can see the screen separating from the bezel again. I worry HP will not repair it even though this is clearly a defective or faulty part seeing as it has broke, been replaced, and is now breaking again. I am extremely turned off from ever buying an HP product again and I think HP should do right by their consumers in fixing this issue.  Is there any solution for this?

A broken hinge seems to be a very common problem with these gaming laptops.This laptop was purchased  new in December 2018, a few weeks ago the laptop would make creaking and cracking noises when I would open or close it.The hinge just completely broke and the screen is completely misaligned with the body and the bezel and back of the screen are coming off and I can see the hinge under it now. This is with normal usage and the laptop would stay on my desk.Does HP plan to do anything about such a widespread problem with what appears to be defective parts?

Ok, so about a month ago I made a post in HP support about my computer having a broken hinge. A member of the HP support team reached out to me and said I had a few options for going about this. Option 1 I pay $300 dollars to send my computer in and get the hinge replaced. Option 2, I receive a $250 value to the HP store to purchase an new unit. However when I contacted the support member about what I wanted to do, they did not respond. I then made the same post and was told to reach out to the HP phone support team, but when I try to talk to them I'm directed back to the HP virtual assistant, and if I want to actually talk to someone I get charged a fee. I would like to talk to someone on the HP support team over the phone but apparently that's a near impossible task. Please help me.

      I've seen this issue a few times on this forum so I'm assuming its a manifacturing flaw. I own a HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15 and I have been using it for over a year now. However for the last month, I have noticed difficulty opening and closing the laptop and after searching carefully found out that the hinge is broken and some portion of the hinge looks exposed and some portions of the screen case looks a bit exposed also. Because of this, the laptop cant close at all, or if it does, it closes incorrectly. I have never dropped the laptop and never caused any physical damage to the laptop due to negligence. My question is, will warranty cover the repair of the broken hinge and exposed screen case, since its such a known issue with this laptop? Thanks in advance.

2.5 years old and the left hinge has broken and caused the screen to crack. I have kept this laptop on my desk for the last few weeks and have never used it in tablet mode during this time. Upon opening the lid up, I heard a crack and noticed the left hinge had separated from the screen. Luckily the computer is working okay for now but this seems to be a recurring issue for many people with this laptop. It looks like a manufacturing/design defect.

So, the screen broke right above the left hinge a couple of months ago. I got it fixed and got it back about 2 weeks ago. The computer has been used twice since then and the screen has broken in the same exact spot in the same exact way. I started looking online because this has not been user negligence and the computer has been kept put away in a case while not in use. Lo and behold there is a problem with hinges and other people having cracked screens. My computer has a wobbly hinge (which was not addressed by Best Buy when i sent it for the screen to be repaired). So far, I'm out $530, and I'm not spending another $530 for a new screen that has been broken by a faulty hinge. It is not user errors causing the broken screens. I would like this resolved so the $800 I spent on the computer in June of this year can be useable without having to have the screen replaced all the time. So, if anyone knows how to get in touch with the powers that be on how to get this sorted and hopefully a refund for having the first screen repaired (it was never dropped, hit, sat on, closed on anything, or had anything done to it the first time to have caused the crack in the screen).  Same for this time. It is in a padded backpack case with nothing else, nothing was put on it, nothing was in it when it was closed, it hasn't been dropped or hit, and it has the exact same damage in the exact same spot. Where the loose hinge is. I don't want to take it back to Best Buy for the repair because I'll again be told it was something we did and be charged $530 to replace the screen (at that point it would be better to just go for a computer that doesn't have those problems and with a company that doesn't pass the blame of faulty craftmanship of the product to users damaging the product).

Previously, I have had broken touchscreen issue caused by hardware faults but never bothered getting it fixed as it was going to cost me half the price of the laptop. Yet recently the right hinge has broken so the laptop cannot be shut at all and the screen is becoming discoloured. I was wondering if there is any way I can get a part for the entire screen portion of the laptop (screen, back panel, hinges etc). If so where can I find this part?

Hi, My omen laptop has had a terrible issue with the hinges. they started by being really stiff each time i opened and closed the screen, until it becames so bad it eventually cracked the main case.The worst part is that the screen case is now broken and i cannot decently use my laptop.I have contacted the local HP third party customer service where i live and they were unable to give me a solution. I am really upset and i feel like a complete idiot for having bought this computer, given that i found so many threads on the same subject.

Hello! The left corner of my laptop seems to have split open at the hinge and now the plastic is coming off of the screen casing. It cracks terribly when I open or close it and appears to be breaking more each time. I'm just outside of the 1 year warranty but can't afford a new laptop as a grad student. I saw a previous post where this seemed to be happening to a lot of people and am hoping to get in touch with a mod that can help me.  Thank you!

Hello! My laptop hinges are both broken. Many pieces of plastic have chipped off of the interior of my laptop, and I think a few screws have also gone missing. I don’t know what to do. My laptop’s exterior is now a mess that can’t stay open properly. I have only had it for close to two years and only use it for school. I am just so upset that my laptop has gotten in such bad shape within a short period of having it. Does anyone know the procedure I could go through to have HP fix it? The warranty is gone, but I would like to know if HP would fix it. I just don’t know what to do, because I don’t want to spend a lot of money trying to fix my laptop.

I purchased an Pavilion X360 14m cd-0001 dx in May 2019. For over a year, it was a good computer that fit my needs. In August 2020, the right hinge failed. This required a case replacement and a new hinge installed by a repair company. Now less than a year later, March 2021, this replacement hinge is failing as well. I currently can't open and close the laptop lid, which makes it difficult and impractical to transport from home to work. This laptop is used by an adult and it is not abused in any way. While this is out of warranty, the repeated failure of the hinge seems to me a design flaw that HP should address. What can I do to get a permanent fix to this repeated problem?

						My computer was purchased about two years ago. Only recently my computer made this cracking noise when I closed it. I looked around and couldn't find the issue until today when the trim around my screen was pulled off by half of my left plastic hinge, the bottom half. The hinge is in great condition and will even clip back on, but the issue is internally. Stripping back the trim and taking off the battery revealed the metal inside with connected by the hinge to my lid had come off; a black plastic gear that the metal thing had connected to had cracked and broken off. I don't know how to fix this. I am unable to open or close the lid for because of the broken connection on the left side, my plastic bottom hinge will not move, thus tearing my trim off the lid when I try to open or close.

I bought an HP envy x360 m6 1 year 2 months back.As it is an expensive laptop I took very good care of it.But for my luck the left hinge broken apart two days back.I didn't even put much pressure on my laptop anytime.Now it gives me a feel like the whole screen will come off on the left side.Its really nothing of my fault.I even never dropped it  or done anything to my laptop.Then I googled about the same problem and discovered its really a very common problem with every laptop of this kind from you.I always buys only HP laptops(about 4 as of now) but this thing makes me think about it next time.There is nothing of my fault except a very poor design from you guys.I think you should recall all these laptops.This is unfair.Hope you guys do something about it without escalating it further.

I was a big fan of HP notebooks but my faith and confidence got shattered with this HP Hinge issue. When I bought this HP Pavilion x360, the sales rep in Dubai was marketing this notebook with key features to use it as tablet, 360 foldable. I asked a simple question what happens to hinges in routine use of laptop with  folding and unfolding,  I was told nothing will happen in the life of this notebook. Just in 3-3.5 years time, Hinges have popped out on the left side of the notebook. The body case is open from left side. Any solution to these hinge problems. I saw there were some posts of recall of notebooks due to hinge problem, but we never got notified or request for recall due to the hinge problem.

Hi, I have a HP Envy x360 that has a broken Hinge which caused damage to the touch screen. I now cant use the laptop at all because I cant see what is happening on the screen. I bought this laptop only 4 months ago and when opening the laptop the other day the right screen hinge cracked open to cause the damage. I went onto HP support on WhatsApp to send photos and describe the Issue. The service Rep said he was going to check with the Production Validation team 4 days ago and get back to me but no one has got back to me. I have been messaging on Whatsapp but Im being ignored. Im not able to do any work and this is causing a big hassle not knowing what is going on. I can see other people have had the same issue with this hinge breaking. Does anyone another way to contact Support? Im under warranty and this is terrible customer service by HP. Im ready to put an official complaint to the NSW Fair Trading here in Australia.regardsAG

As I lifted the screen of my HP Envy x360 today the left hinge popped apart and cracked my screen. I am shocked that it would break like this considering I take very good care of the laptop. It has never been dropped or bumped. I have only ever used it at home and almost never use it in tablet mode. According to my serial number the warranty expired last week, but I believe HP should repair or replace it free of charge considering the price of the laptop and the level of care I have given it.  It seems like this is a known issue with this laptop model, as I have found several others that had similar issues such as those linked below.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-on-HP-Envy-x360/t...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Envy-360-hinge-broke-and-caused-sc...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-and-cracked-scree...

I misplaced the originals.Note: I purchased the ""kit"" from an online store, however these screws were not  included. I'm sure this was an issue with the seller since their picture actually showed them as being included.

Hello! So my computer on the left side part connected to my keyboard, right under the left hinge is having problems. It looks as if it is coming apart, and I believe it is due to the hinge on the right side. That right hinge does not stay together either and sticks out, I think it is negatively affecting the laptop. What is the best way to fix this issue? No problems have occurred with the hardware itself but I think it would cause it eventually.

HP Team, I need your help - my loved laptop has NEVER been dropped, mishandled, or abused, and the fourth time I used it in tablet mode the hinge on the left side broke. The screen is detaching from the case and the laptop is out of warranty.  I have tried to use the virtual assistant on HP customer service, but it is of no help, and it is simply ridiculous to have to buy a subscription to speak to a customer service representative. I paid a lot of money for this laptop (more than $1K), and it is unacceptable to have no official customer service that can help fix this hardware issue, which apparently was widely known by HP... I would like the laptop repaired - I don´t mind taking it to a repair shop if needed be, but I need it fixed free of charge. What are the steps for me to get this problem fixed?

Hi, I could use some advice. The right hinge on my HP 17z laptop is broken. It is slowly splintering into tiny pieces. If I took a picture of it, it would look normal, but there's a small crunching sound when I move the screen, and tiny plastic shards on my desk.  The bezel right above the hinge is also now pushing out from the screen a little.  I didn't drop it or damage it; I am guessing there was a crack in  there that got bigger, and now the hinge is slowly coming apart. I can open and close the laptop, but I'm afraid to, so I only use the ""Sleep"" mode to temporarily power down. Everything (but the hinge) on the laptop works fine. I bought it in July 2017, 13 months ago, so frustratingly the laptop has broken when just 1 month out of warranty. There are is so much good and bad advice on the web about how to handle this, so I thought I'd ask HP users. What do you think? Do I attempt to buy parts and repair myself? Bring it in somewhere? Thanks!

My HP Envy laptop is just two years old and recently, simply closing the screen the left hinge broke. The damage from the hinge spread to the screen.  I invested my money in this laptop because I trusted HP and their laptops, but now looking into it I see that numerous people have had the same issue with the faulty hinge. I did not mistreat it and always open and close it from the center. This thing is out of warranty, but seeing the same issue pop up again and again for this particular machine, I can't help but think that HP is in some way responsible for selling a faulty product. Can HP repair my laptop or help in anyway? At the very least I sincerely suggest you consider recalling this model of the HP Envy and revise the construction of the hinges. We bought two of these machines on the same day, I wonder when my wife's is going to fall apart?

Hi, I have had this laptop since December 2017 and have always handled the laptop very carefully - the laptop/hinge has not been used excessively. Unfortunately today I have found the hinge to have broken. The screen bezel wants to come away from the screen when opening the lid. From what I have read, this appears to be a common issue and potentially a design flaw. Can you please advise how I should proceed? Kind regards Mark

One of the hinges on my laptop has broken and the casing around the display has come away from the screen and there are wires exposed. My laptop lid will not close. If I force it, it looks like it will snap. HP's manufacturers warranty says that ""This HP Limited Warranty applies only to HP-branded and Compaq-branded hardware products, ,... The term ""HP Hardware Product"" is limited to the hardware components and required firmware"" It goes on to state that ...""HP guarantees that it will repair, replace, or refund, at HP's option, an HP Hardware Product that manifests a defect in materials or workmanship during the Limited Warranty Period, ....HP's obligation under this HP Limited Warranty, at its option, to repair, replace, or provide a refund for an HP Hardware Product that manifests a defect in materials and workmanship ceases upon the expiration of the Limited Warranty Period.' I read this that the hinge defect is clearly a defect in a hardware component and a defect in materials or workmanship and would be covered  under HP's manufacturers warranty. If I have had the laptop for less than 12 months, is this covered?

Like many others on this message board, the hinge on my HP Envy x360 broke unexpectedly. A screw and piece of plastic fell out. I took it to a computer shop which told me this issue was caused by a design flaw on HP's part, and through no fault of my own. My laptop is now out of warranty, but I see from other postings, that HP has recognized the design flaw and is willing to replace this at no cost. Please provide me with the information necessary to begin the repair process, and get this issue resolved as soon as possible. Thank you.

  Let me begin by saying that for at least the last 15 years I have purchased only HP computers and printers, and have always been pleased with the performance of the products and with customer service. As is common with thousands of others HP Envy users, the hinge on mine finally broke (I assume it is broken, or at the very least, is loose). There are no ""rattling"" noises inside, pc still works fine overall. However, when the system is on, and I move the lid, sometimes the screen goes blank, sometimes it even restarts - sometimes it even goes into automatic repair mode. I ran sfc /scannow - issues were found and repaired (so maybe that solved the automatic repair mode), but screen still goes blank when lid is moved, and I have to do a hard reset (press and hold power button) to get it back. [content removed] I am posting this in the community forum, as there does not seem to be any other way to reach HP. I await HP's response.

HiJust to say ive had to put up with both hinges broken on this marvellous laptop, i say marvellous because as a laptop and its funcionality its an incredible machine and im devastated to be still reading after all these years of hinges breaking on thousands of machines, HP still have not addressed the issue in the manufacture/design, nor it seems addressed the issues or accepted it actually is an issue!, (when you attempt to fix a metal screw in a plastic moulded lump encasing a thread for the screw to be affixed, and that part is close to the fan pushing out the heat from the machine then the weakest part of that is the plastic!, WHICH IS THE BIT THATS BREAKING ALL OVER THE WORLD) there, cant be any plainer than that now can i? Anyways, i just wanted to say that ive struggled on with my hinges broken now for over 5 years, and now its time to buy a new laptop, ive read as i mentioned that HP have DONE NOTHING to fix the issue so am actively looking to spend my £1500 with another company, if anyone has any suggestions on makes im open to ideas? Many thanks MartinUK

My hinge broke on my 15 month old Envy 360 and the screen around it cracked. . This is a known issue but I can’t contact anyone for support or help. There are no emails or phone numbers available to contact a human. I really need this laptop to be working. Rn I can’t even close it!

Hi, I purchased an HP Envy x360 coming up on 2 years ago, and I have had no problems with it other than it getting hot until 2 days ago when one of the hinges on the laptop started to break. I have not dropped the laptop or anything, and when I brought it in to get evaluated, the fix was appraised at $200.

 I had purchased HP Laptop, Model No 15 - cs/6GR92uA , Serial Number :[Personal Information Removed]from Staples, Folsome on November 30, 2019. The display frame along with one hinge got broken by itself, just one day after the warranty period got over.
I strongly believe that the particular product I had received is a defective piece, as extreme care was taken, and the laptop was never dropped once.
Moreover, when enquired in the authorised HP Service Center here at Chennai (India), they are quoting a repair charge of Rs.22047 ($301), which is over half the price of the laptop itself, and a cost I can't afford.
Therefore, it's a humble request of mine, to kindly look into my situation and replace the laptop.

In Dec 2019 I bought 2 HP ENVY - 13-aq0011ms from the Microsoft store.  About 2 months ago, one of the hinges broke on one of the laptops I bought.  I used it for about 2 weeks, then the 2nd hinge on the same laptop broke.   This caused the display to flop around and the bottom of the laptop to bulge.  I thought ok, I must have somehow did something to break it, and I am somewhat technical both with computers and repairs.  So I looked into what I need to fix it and bought a new keyboard piece from eBay  for $90.   I fixed the laptop and it is working fine now (minus a problem it has had for 6 months where the SD card does not lock inside and the rubber strips that do not stick back on since you have to remove them to get access to the screws).  Well today the other laptop that is the exact same model bought at the same time, got the same issue with both hinges popping out.  I know from my repair the problem is that HP really cheeped out and the display is held in place with just PLASTIC.  So I figured this can not be just a coincidence, so I started looking into hinge problem and found the ton of messages here with the exact same problem.  This is ridiculous, what do I need to do to get this fixed?  As there no reason that 2 laptops should not last under 2 years without major damage like this!

Hi,  I have had my HP 17 inch touchsmart for just over a year now and for the last couple months the left hinge has become an issue/ not working correctly. The hinge is coming out of its socket and moves downward when I open my computer. Also, by pushing the screen back, the black bottom side of the laptop is actually breaking away from my computer. I have been using this laptop very carefully and rarely move it off the desk.  At this point the laptop has to remain completely stationary and it will not close completely.I saw similar posts from other people and seems to be a reoccurring problem,  do you have advice or a correction to fix?  Very disappointed in the purchase.

I purchased my HP Envy 360 13 months and 10 days ago. I have been very happy with it until this morning when unexpectedly, the hinge began to break. I use this laptop for work, but only on a desk and have never mistreated it. I see no reason this should be happening with the normal use of just one year. I purchased an HP based on my positive experience with our HP Printer and am very disappointing to find that this is a regular problem that has been posted about numerous times within this forum as well as other places on the internet. Of course, this happened 40 days after my 1-year warranty expired. Being that this is a regularly reported and known issue I would greatly appreciate it if HP could repair my computer and address this issue via a recall or redesign. I thought I purchased one of the best products available and was happy to pay a higher price for an HP, so to see this known issue is very shocking. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

My college age daughter was attempting to close her 2 in 1 screen after she had been drawing on it, and all of a sudden the hinge just popped thru the screen on the right side, and two screws popped out of the gap in the screen with material around them. She has always been very careful about how she moves the display back and forth, and the sudden damage created by what seems to be a faulty hinge surprised and frightened her. Looking thru the history on this support page, it seems this is a recurring issue for this model, and I am wondering if there are any recalls, or information on material defects. I have an extended warranty I could use to replace the laptop, but they are stating they can only replace it if I can have something stating this is a defect of some kind. I took the laptop to an HP approved repair shop in town, and they gave me estimates on the repair, but said that they can't state/determine if its a defect issue, and I have to contact HP. This forum seems to be the only place to do so.  I have been a long time HP customer, and have never had an experience like this with HP hardware. I would hate for something like this to be the end of our relationship, but this whole process has been frustrating, and seems like it should have never happened if this laptop had been as sturdy as it should have been.  Can someone please help me with this situation? What can HP do to make this right?

The laptop screen has detached from the hinged part on the left side. This happened without the laptop being dropped or damaged. When I went to close the laptop after work it would not close and I noticed the damaged side. Disappointing considering I have not had any other major issues with the laptop until now.... Is there a fix for this? I see that there are issues with the hinge that have been posted before and I did see that it looks like this has happened to toher people with this laptop.

The left hinge on my x360 Envy laptop broke with no warning and no indication of any problems ever. We have not abused this laptop in any way and it just has been used in an ordinary fashion, like any other 2-in-1 that mimics a tablet. We have used it for years and has worked flawlessly all these years, but this is a fatal problem making the computer unusable. Based on all of the posts on this exact same issue, this is clearly a design flaw. The hinged froze in the half-way open mode (the display is stuck on the same plane as the keyboard). The hinge is frozen and won't budge, even under substantial pressure, and it has come loose from the display, so I'm very concerned that the wire to the display, which is now exposed, will break. There is a small hinge pin sticking out of the frozen hinge that was connected to the display. I called the local uBreakiFix repair shop listed on the HP website, but they said they are very familiar with this problem, but they cannot get the parts from HP to fix it. PLEASE HELP!

I spent $1,200 in 2017 to purchase the HP Envy 17'' which I've loved. For quite awhile now the hinge corner pops every time I open or close the laptop. I've never dropped the computer and am super careful at all times. My primary computer and I'm concerned it might get worse. Just discovered that there are quite a lot of posts on this topic. Unfortunately my warranty is long over. Any suggestions on whether HP will help on this or whether I should just make sure I'm constantly backed-up with continued use?

HP Pavilion X360  Model #14t-cd100    ProdID#4DZ14AV.  I'm 2 like 2 weeks out of warranty.  Due to Covid, I have not gotten anyone to look at it to give formal diagnose and price to fix.  Talking on phone yields about $600 to fix!!!!!   Lower Right Hinge broke free from top cover.  Caused display unit to pop out. The Glass (I believe is a digitized glass?) cracked from upper right corner to about midscreen.  The Glass is also separating from display.  The tapped brass knurls at the hinge (that are embedded in plastic of the top cover) ripped free from top cover.   Upon reboot of machine, everything appears to work except touchscreen.  Display is sharp, doesnt appear to be pixel loss or strange lines (leads me to believe only glass is cracked).  Reboot using F2 to run touchscreen diagnostic.  The diagnositc with squares shows no response at crack for a few squares.  moving the boxes diagonally does not work at area of crack.  For both tests, everything works.  Using touch screen in windows 10 resulted in jumpy mouse pointer. It appeared the computer was receiving inputs from the touchscreen without even touching it (last opened files would open just staring at the screen). After disable of touchscreen thru device manager, everything working well (except of course closing the cover) on the computer. Display is sharp, doesnt appear to be pixel loss or strange lines (leads me to believe only glass is cracked).   Thoughts?   At worst I assume I need a new top cover, hinges & display with glass.....  I'd like to get a specific build sheet for this laptop......If I have to go that route.    Help!

 I bought an HP Envy x360 Convertible 15m-ed0xx for my wife back in September 2020. It's been a pretty solid machine until last night. She went to close it and the right hinge popped. I'm sure it's out of warranty but is it possible to get this fixed? This laptop hasn't not been dropped or mistreated in any way. There seems to be a loose screw in there too. As you can see, the laptop can no longer be closed at all so any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

In August 2020, I sent my Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0058wm to HP for warranty service due to a broken hinge. Although it was supposed to be 2-Day Return Repair, I subsequently received multiple emails reporting that the repair would be delayed but without any reason why. After waiting for 2-plus weeks, I ultimately called Support and was informed that the repair was delayed in the aftermath of Hurricane Isias. Imagine my surprise when a refurbished laptop, not my original computer, arrived at my home about 3 days later. Obviously, I had to reload many of my programs and backup files. However, I did notice that the laptop did not reboot as quickly as my original model.  This evening, I figured out the reason: The model I received back is the 15-cx0056wm and lacks the  Optane SSD in my original unit.  I'm unsure if there are other hardware differences between these models. Does anyone know how I can remedy this situation? I 'm officially out-of-warranty as of 2 weeks ago.

Hello, I have a HP Pavilion g7-2224nr. For the 2nd time now the housing has broken at the hinge by the fan. Last time I was able to find another g7-2224nr housing to replace it with very cheap online. My question is I have access to a g7-2292nr really cheap missing HDD. Are parts interchangable between housings?

Hello, I have had my laptop for almost two years now (in December 2022), and used it only for studying and work purposes. Recently I noticed that the hinge in the right corner popped up. After researching this issue, I have noticed that many people who owned this type of laptop had the same problem and this is a manufacturing flaw, not related to the misuse of the device. The hinge got broken with no drops or damage to the laptop. I also found out that many HP customers had their laptops fixed due to this bad design. Furthermore, due to the hinge breaking the scene got cracked too. Could you please help? What is the best course of action in this case? Regards

I have a HP Envy 15, and had originally gotten a warranty. My hinge broke while under warranty, so I shipped it to HP to fix it for me. However, it broke again, and my warranty is now expired. Since a lot of people have had issues with breaking hinges with no misuse, and HP has already fixed my computer once, is HP doing anything for those who bought these faulty laptops?

Recently my notebook broke in the left hand corner where the hinge is, just beside the lighted on/off switch. The case is cracked but hasn't broken off yet. I'm being very careful so as not to make the situation worse. I bought the notebook in 2016 and standard warranty expired in 2017. I took the extended warranty (care pack) until mid-October 2018, and now we're in mid-2019 and I've got this problem. I've noticed a similar trend with other HP notebooks (Envy and others) in online forums. Is this a common issue? Is there a hidden warranty from HP for this issue that we don't know about? I love this notebook and I'm not ready to buy a new one (if I don't have to).This one does everything that I need. I've upgraded the operating system from Windows 10 home to Windows 10 Pro and it great for me. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  MEF45

I've had this product for almost 3 years now but it has been well looked after! Yesterday I went to close the laptop and heard a popping noise and it seemed difficult to close; the bottom part of the laptop had separated itself, and after inspection by myself and my partner, it seems something to do with the hinge is damaged, which seems to be a common issue here in the forums! I left my laptop open as moving the hinge seemed to cause more separation, so it is useable for now, but I'm too scared to close it to take a closer look in case something else breaks, or I cannot open it again.  And after scouring the manual it suggests taking apart the laptop myself will void any warranty, so I don't really want to mess with it too much anyway.  The problem is I only have 3 months warranty left, and due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, I cannot take it anywhere to get repaired; I searched the HP website and it suggests there are no repair or service centres in the UK, and the laptop was originally purchased from Currys, which is closed at the moment. The laptop was purchased for me by my grandparents before I started university, and I'm now close to the end of my third and final year, dealing with extra anxiety in the current climate about my laptop completely dying on me whilst I try and finish my dissertation and other assignments.

I found that the webcam was no longer displaying in the Device Manager.c) I tried reinstalling the device by removing the driver and package and rebooting it.d) Downloading and reinstalling the drivers manually  This attempt was especially upsetting, as I received the following error message after the attempt: I'm not sure what the above error even means at this point, and I have spent more than a few very frustrated hours in an attempt to fix this issue. Thank you for any and all assistance.

Like MANY others I have issue with broken hinge on my HP Envy 360. Of course, it broke only a few days after the warranty expired.  I have tried to get help using the virtual assistant, but that is useless.  To get phone help you have to buy time, since my warranty just expired.   So hopefully I can get a response from someone in HP this way.   I noticed online that there is a class action lawsuit being filed in Florida because of the defective hinges in the HP Envy and Pavillion models.   The product was sold knowing there was an issue with the hinges. I have been extremely easy on my laptop. It hasn't been dropped, hit or misused in any way.  I don't have pets, children or any one that treats this laptop harshly.  It has only been a year that I have had it and I rarely every fold it over to use in tablet mode, so the hinges have not been used more than what is normal.   I hope it will be repaired by HP without too much trouble.  With hinges that will last and not break again.  I have been keeping the laptop open since I noticed the issue, so that it won't break even more.    I noticed that one person said that they had to contact the VP of HP to get help. Maybe I should do that also.

I was given an HP Deskjet 5650. It appears to function, but the latches that hold the ink cartridges in place have broken. They snap off close to the hinge.

The hinges from my laptop screen are broken. I don't know how, because I just opened my laptop and I saw something was wrong. Does this fall under the warranty or not?

Hello,The hinges that support the screen have cracked open the frame and are now bulging out. I have never used my laptop in a way that would damage it, so I believe this to be a manufacturing issue. Can anything be done about this? My laptop functions very well otherwise, and I would hate to have to replace it because of this issue. The issue started approximately a year after I bought it. I did not, however, do anything about it back then as I thought it wouldn't cause any future problems.  Thanks in advance.  Best, Merve

 As the other customers/owners have written to express their problem with the left hinge broken, etc., I, too, have the same problem.  On July 27, 2018, I went to open my computer, which up until this time I had no issue with opening my computer, nor has it been in any accidents or dropped, and I heard a sound which you should not hear  when opening one's laptop.  I stopped and examined my laptop and noticed a scratch across  the left hinge,  Hmmmm I said to myself.  On continuing to try to open my computer, the left hinge broke and there was a nasty crack across the corner of the laptop.  Now I'm unable to close the lid of my laptop and must secure it, unplug it, replug it, all before I can be sure nothing will happen to it.  Now, unfortunately, my computer is out of extended warranty as of May, 2018.  Whether it matters or not, I was unable to extend my warranty as to a couple of very stress related months and I don't know what to do as I feel this problem is due to a design flaw on your end as the other people have mentioned.  Please advise as to what help you can offer me and as soon as possible, please.  Your attention will be most appreciated. Inside computer - broken hinge - leftCrack on the outside of computer

My HP envy x360 has a broken hinge. I did not drop it or anything--the hinge just gave up just now. Can't find a phone number for call center but need to get it fix quickly. It is still working but I have not tried to physically close the labtop since the screen split at the bottom right corner when I try to move the monitor. Need help quickly since I need the computer for work and need to move around.

Hi! It seems like what is a common occurrance (see below for a few links I found within the span of a minute indicating how common it appears to be), I was using my HP Envy one day and one of the hinges gave out. This meant that whenever I tried moving the screen, the left corner popped loose and plastic pieces started breaking. This led me to leaving my laptop on my desk, making it absolutely unusable for my job and for everyday use. When I tried contacting customer support, they just kept repeating it was out of warrenty, trying to direct me to their paid ""Smartfriend"" service. This is especially annoying since this is a known  flaw within HP Envy products and customer support was not willing to admit that, trying to get me to pay money for something that was out of my control. I was wondering if there was any way to fix this or to get HP to fix it, given that this appears to be a manufactering fault in the first place. Links range from 2015 to 2022, showing that despite years and years of complaints, HP has done nothing to fix their faulty product:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-on-HP-Envy-x360/t...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebooks-Archive-Read-Only/Defective-Hinges-on-HP-Laptops-Envy/td-p/5...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Left-Hinge-Broken-Corner-of-La...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Right-Hinge-Broke...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-envy-360-broken-hinge-from-...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/td-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p...  https://www.bestbuy.com/site/questions/hp-envy-x360-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16...https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDLaptops/comments/kx3tw7/hp_envy_x360_laptop_right_hinges_so_fragileit/

HiI have strange problem with CP5525, I need to replace print cartridge but I cannot open the front door. I can move the front door only about 4-5 cm (measured at top side) and then it stops. I have experience with many HP printers, and the front doors always open without using any strong force. I have here also CP3525dn, which looks very similar (except it is only A4) and it is extremly easy to open front doors, no force needed.One time I had similar problem with HP LaserJet CM2320fxi. In that case, front door couldn’t open as well (but it moves much more, probably to half of the distance) it stuck at half and when I used more force, the plastic hinge broken. Then, obviously, front door did open but I couldn't get out the cartridge slot, so it had to go to service and they told us, that it is not worth to repair. In that case it was old printer which had many other problems, so it was not that much of a problem.But in case of CP5525, it is very expensive printer and only A3 printer here, so this time, I want to be much more careful. And one strange thing, first time I want to check toners was, when I noticed, that it is some problem with printing blue color. So I did the internal print quality check and noticed, that paper number 3 which supposed to be all blue is completely white except of couple of squares and lines, also one page should by half yellow half green but both was completely yellow. So in the manual, it stated that in this case, it should be a problem with cyan cartridge. Then when I want to check the cyan cartridge, I realize, that I cannot open the front door. I don’t know if it can cause the front door stuck, or if this two issues are somehow connected, but I rather mention it.Also I have to point out, that this is first time I wanted to open the front door on this particular printer, so I don’t know if it is normal for this printer, that the front door is so hard to open.So please, can you help me, what can I do with it? If it can be something wrong with the printer, that prevent the front door to open?Thank you

I have the HP ENVY Laptop 13. Over the past few months the hinge has broken and has popped the bottom casing and left the screen not particularly stable. I have always been very careful with the laptop and this isn't the first issue I've had with it, having to send it back while still under warranty for them to fix other issues.
 
Where I can find the correct replacement hinges?
 
Thanks in advance!

I've had a HP 17"" laptop for one year. The hinge appeared to be broken on one side. I took it apart and found small plastic pieces broken off near the hinges. I glued everything back, but realized when I tried to attach the plastic case to the bottom, two of the four plastic buffers that are attached to the inside of the case are virtually gone, broken off.  They are the most crucial of the four because they are the two outside holes near the hinges. I don't think I can fabricate these from scratch.  Does anyone know if I can order a new bottom case for this laptop?

I just received my new Spectre 13 yesterday. But there are some problems and i'm wondering to what extend they are normal. My biggest problem is a strange noise coming from inside. Not really a coil whine. More like a crackling/popping/scratching noise. Almost like a old defective dvd drive or something like that. It's not the fans, i am sure of that at least. I googled the problem and searched the forums over here. Some people say that changing processor power management to 99% max could fix it. The problem is: i don't have that option... Also, there is additonal coil whine present while the spectre is in standby and the fans start up from time to time in standby...Besides that problem there are others. A looser shift key on the right side, it's on now, but the feeling is weird and wrong. Not like other keys. Then there is a problem with the screen, well, actualy more than one. Some dead pixels and a weird thing where the whole image is distorded for a splitseconds an jumps back to normal.Then there is da crooked hinge on the right side (maybe the cause of the display problems?) I'm really disapointed becaus of those things. The Spectre would be an awesome machine, if it wasn't for that stuff... I would send it back, but it was on sale and i would pay 20% more now... And i have to go to the hospital for a few weeks due to vertebral fractures.The spectre was supposed to be my lifeline and entertainment for that period. I don't know what to do and i don't know if those problem are normal... Sorry for any broken english, it's not my first language.

The left hinge is causing the display screen to separate and not work correctly. I have seen that this is a common problem with this laptop.I bought this refurbished a little over a year ago for about 500. No drops or bad treatment. I noticed the screen is darker along both sides of the display for a few inches today. It is difficult to see what is under the dark areas. That lead me to noticing the hinge. Is it better to get it fixed or go buy something else. I hate to just write it off, but if I get it fixed, is it prone to happen again?What have others done?Thanks.

Hi there, I see that many other people on this forum are experiencing the same issue and I would really appreciate help or guidance.  My laptop was my first ever big 'adult' purchase, so it has been handled with absolute care (more than I care to admit).Winter 2020, I opened my laptop carefully and the black frame mounted around the screen popped out on the bottom left corner. The hinge on the left is now giving way,  causing stress to the other hinge on the right. It now appears that it could at any moment release the screen. I am now unable to move the laptop screen from the 90-degree angle and unable to close the laptop together, which is causing huge problems as it no longer can be travelled. (Which was one of the reasons for purchasing my laptop....)However, my laptop is over a year old so that means the warranty is out. My brother, who works in IT dealing with software/manufacturing issues, had a look at my laptop for me and showed me how this was very clearly a design fault, and he recommended that I get in touch with HP as they should be aware of this fault so should be more than happy to help. So I rang up and spoke to an HP representative and I explained everything thoroughly and precisely, not missing out on any key information. They told me that they are finding this to be a common manufacturing defect which many are facing (evident when you type in this model/make on this site or on Google) and that they would need me to send evidence of the fault. I was more than happy to send pictures and videos, so I sent them over as soon as the phone call ended. The reply I received told me they believe it was 'accidental damage' caused by myself so I would have to pay to get it repaired, which is hundreds of pounds.Stunned by the reply, I felt defeated. I went through the story again and was met with a disgruntled sigh, explaining how it appeared to be damage I caused to my laptop and again that I would need to pay for it.I'm not gonna lie, I'm very disappointed, actually miffed off would be the correct term (that's the watered-down version) that HP sold me a laptop with this known issue. If you type in ""hinge screen issue"" on this forum or Google you can see that this is a very common problem.  I have had to use a 'temporary' measure, such as using tape to put around the frame on the outside. To think that I spent £649 on this laptop, handled with such care and attention for it now to be broken, a complete eyesore, and for the screen to be completely unmovable, leaving it at a 90-degree angle and completely untravelable is such a stab in the back. Especially as it was no fault of my own! Taking no responsibility for this manufacturing fault has left a very poor taste in my mouth, and the customer service I received was truly atrocious.  I can not begin to express my disappointment with what has happened and I can only recommend that you stay away from HP products.I will not be rushing to buy HP products again that's for sure.  Has anyone who has/had this issue manage to get it corrected?  Help please!

I noticed issues with my left hinge on my computer about a month ago. Nothing major, until now it has broken, cracked my screen, and I am scared to close my laptop. I have had this laptop for only 2 years. I am very frustrated as I can't find anywhere to fix it because of the part that is broken is hard to find. I am a college student and do not have the time or the resources to be dealing with a broken laptop. I have researched and saw that MANY other envy users have had this same issue with the same hinge. I also found that the HP is aware of this issue, yet has done nothing to change it. Had I known this before purchasing my laptop, I simply would have never bought it. I really liked this laptop in compared to my old Lenovo, but I am unsure if I will ever shop at HP ever again if I can't get this fixed. Is ther anything I can do?

I grabbed an envy 360 in late November, 16 cores and 64 gb of RAM. I have 3 desktops, am M1 air and an iPad Pro, so it doesn’t get a lot of use. Today I picked it up and sat down on the couch and started to fold it over into tablet form. Never had any issue doing it before. This time, the hinge, casing and screen on one side just starts to separate like it’s just dissolving in front of me. I know y could not believe it. It was almost unreal. A tiny bit of plastic falls out, then a screw, and out of nowhere this thing is toast. I figured this has got to be some crazy random rare event. Certainly not mentioned in the reviews I read. But then I start looking around and it’s bad news on top of bad. Seems super common, worse, seems HP is not interested in taking responsibility for it. is that still the state of the world? Did I just rent this thing for 6 months at $1600? Or does something more sensible go on these days? I was just warming up to HP  too - seems like I may have messed up - the common, crummy, silly pc laptop hardware situation chased me over to Macs for over a decade. Hard to believe I jumped back over for this.

The right hinge has detached from the plate that it screws into behind the screen. The plastic plate has broken and the threads from which the screws on the hinge should go into are stripped. There are places to buy the hinge, but I really need the part number for the plastic plate that the hinge screws into.

I have had my HP touchscreen laptop since Jan 2020 and have had no problems until the last few months.  I started noticing some problems opening and closing and now I can’t even close it.  When I attempt to close it the it literally comes apart at the hinge and the bottom of the laptop pops out.  I’m pretty sure the warranty is done.  Is there anything HP can do to help repair it?

Hi. We got an HP Envy x360 13"" via the online shop. It was delivered July 29, 2020, which means it still is under warranty. We got it while in the US. We're here now in the Philippines where the unit is being used by my daughter for her online classes. It has never left the house since we got here, it has never been taken outside as all schools here are only doing online classes because of the Covid19 situation. The hinge on the right side broke. We brought it to the HP Service Center where they told us they'd inspect it and determine what parts need to be replaced. They also told us that  if parts needed aren't available locally then they'd source outside the country. Now, we got a message from them saying that they can't repair the unit as the part needed for the unit isn't supported here and that it needs to be returned to the country of  origin, and that we can get it from them now. Is this what  HP service is? We're left to our own resources to have this unit fixed. Checking the community forum, it appears that this issue with Envy x360 hinge is widespread. I'm hoping HP can solve our problem.

The left hinge of my HP Envy x360 laptop broke, If I close it or move it from 90 degrees, the screen pops out of the casing on the bottom left at the hinge because it is stuck in place. I think it may have broken off internally, but I'm not sure.I know this a common problem, but since my warranty is out I do not want to pay for a obvious design flaw on the laptop. This is the second time this has happened to me. I got the hinge replaced in April 2021. Not even a year apart from a new hinge.  I've been very careful with my laptop and I do not force the lid close or anything that would cause this damage. Even after the hinge broke the first time, I thought it was somewhat of a fluke and I even convinced my sister to buy this laptop for university. I'm having my doubts about hp. As said here: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinge-on-Envy-x360-Conv...> Searching the forum it appears to me that this is a design flaw in the hinge for the Envy x360 series.  I've found several posts with the exact same problem.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Quality-issues-with-Envy-x360-...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Breaking-hinge-on-HP-EN...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...However a few of the above posts imply that HP may be doing something about remediation for those affected by this apparent design flaw. I hope that I can receive a repair for this as I need it for school and am unable to purchase a new laptop at this time.

We buy a new laptop about every 2 years. I run an in-home business and I find that computers just start to have issues after that amount of time. My 11-year-old son bought one for himself a year ago after saving money for years and I don't think his made it 6 months before the hinges broke. Now that I am looking into fixing that my own laptop's hinges are giving out! There is no easy fix to this if you notice there is a hinge issue it is already too late to just replace the hinges. I opened my son's and here is the list of items I had to put on order this morning.1. LCD Hinges $18.002. bottom cover $41.99 (due to broken screw mounts)3. backplate cover $39.00 (due to broken screw mounts)4. palm rest case $50.00 (due to broken screw mounts)basically everything on the outside of the computer needs to be replaced and then I have to switch the internal over to the new case. So those of you that are saying there is no fix to this. Yes, there is a fix you just need to look for your computer model number and look at your parts list and know what items you need to order. that information can be found on this website just by entering your computers serial number or model number.

Hi, I have had my HP 17 since May 2020, and after 11 months of use, the left hinge started coming loose, cracking the plastic around it. I have not been able to close it or travel with it since April of this year (it is now almost August) because it cracks more, knocking the plastic out of place. I have had to hold it together with electrical tape, but now the right side is starting to feel loose too. I have never dropped my laptop, gotten it wet, left it in any extreme temperature, nothing. I take great care of my electronic devices. I had a Dell Inspiron for 11 years that actually still is usable and intact (albeit slow now), but this HP laptop has such thin plastic that it broke after less than a year of use. A quick online search shows that I'm not remotely the first person to have this issue with HP. What can I do to fix this and is HP doing anything to make these computers better quality? --Tierra

I am looking for assistance with repairing a broken hinge on HP Pavilion laptop purchased in 2/16/2019, along with a 3 year Pickup and Return with accidental damage protection for consumer notebooks.  HP seems to think I do not have a warranty so I initiated a case on 12/30/21 to dispute the warranty records.  I have yet to receive a response from HP and there appears to be no way to contact them directly for an update.  The hinge is not functioning and the laptop is stuck in the open position.  The laptop will not close and will likely cause more damage if trying to force it to close.  Some type of hinge repair is needed and I am desperate for HP to acknowledge the 3 year care pack I purchased, which I assume would cover the hinge suddenly to break.  Does anyone have any advice on how to contact HP about warranty status or have experienced a similar issue with their laptop hinges stop working?  Thanks

Yet another left hinge on an Envy x360 that is broken.  Did anyone ever have any luck getting HP to at least provide the parts to repair the problem?  I've taken the laptop apart and see the plastic screw housing that connects to the hinge that is broken.  Tried an epoxy but it wasn't strong enough (as I suspected).  This laptop has better specs than anything else I can afford right now (even though it is 5 years old).  If I knew what components to purchase (or if HP would provide them), I could repair it.

A few weeks ago, the cover of my Notebook started to loosen but snapped back whenever it happened.  This weekend, the bottom corner separated when I tried to close it and there is now a gap on the cover.  The screen is still working but I cannot close the Notebook.  Can the top of the Notebook be replaced for a reasonable price?  Where can I purchase the top and does it require sending the computer to a professional to repair?

I bought 2 identical HP Envy laptops in November 2020. With both of them, the hinge has started coming apart, putting pressure on the screen. It looks as if could crack the screen at any moment. Now there are horizontal lines across the screens rendering them unusable.  This happened to the first laptop just one week after the warranty expired. I have tried a couple of repair places and they have told me that the whole hinge and screen assembly has to be replaced (even though there is nothing wrong with the screen). But they have also told me that spare parts are not available so they cannot be repaired! The same thing has now happened to the second laptop. Neither have been mistreated. This has happened with the screen being opened and closed once each day.Clearly there is a problem with the design since others have experienced the same issue.

I opened my laptop one day (which rarely gets transported anywhere except for around the house on occasion), and the left hinge was just broken. Of course my warranty expired November 2021, even though I purchased the laptop December 2020. Anyway. HP Support recommended I take it to uBreakiFix/Assurion. I took it there - the hinge has become detached from the plastic on the screen, and they want to charge me $400.00+ to get it repaired. It's a $1000.00 laptop that I had (when it broke in May) for 17 months. I see that this is a common problem, and people have had to write to the Executive Director of Escalations, etc. but I can't even get anyone from HP to respond? Where can I start??

This laptop is in warranty, but when I approached Croma and HP center in Pune they are asking me to pay huge amount to replace the hinge.  Why I have to pay for the manufacturing defect. How can I get justice.

I called HP over a week ago to ask them to send a box so I can ship my laptop away for repair (for a repair that is due to their faulty engineering on a less than 6 month old laptop). I let them know on the phone that I would need a box big enough to fit my HP envy fully open because it is unable to close or flip into tablet mode without the screen snapping off due to this manufacturing error. They sent me a box that was too small so I called them back two days later to request and appropriate sized box. This one never arrived. Called them again Monday this week for a bigger box, and once again never arrived (no tracking numbers were sent for these boxes, only the first one). Just tried calling them AGAIN and they bounced me between departments until I was hung up on. I am now over a week without repair for a care pack service that I paid hundreds of dollars for. if you are reading this and thinking about purchasing an HP laptop - RUN.  (additionally, the ""HP employees"" that reply to these threads state that they will be private messaging with help and guess what - NO MESSAGES ARE RECEIVED AT ANY POINT).

I only purchased this laptop in November and even purchased the extended 3 year warranty.  I treat this laptop as gold because I am a university student who requires it for every single thing I do. I contacted the chat for support and they are telling me I don't have any warranty and my care pack invoice/product numbers don't exist. Extremely unhappy with this and disappointed in HP. This is making me regret my purchase and I don't know where to go from here.

I have this same problem on my 2 yr old Envy, in that the base separates when opening due to broken hinges.  Now it has become unusable as each time it starts up I get a 90b fan error warning. I'm guessing that the broken part of the hinge may be trapping or interfering with the internal fan, as if I close it and open it again whilst holding the base together (three-handed job!) it will sometimes boot up ok.Paid £800+ (lot of money as I earn poor wages) for what I thought was going to be a laptop that affords me some future proofing in that it was the latest tech when purchased, but 2yrs???

The right hinge on my HP Envy x360, which is just over a year old (was purchased in December 2017) is broken. Around it, the screen is seperating from the back panel. I'm honestly surprised that a laptop from a popular company is already having hardware issues at just one year old, though after looking through the forums it seems like a common problem with the Envy series. Local repair shops are asking for anywhere from $250 to $500 and HP wants $400 for a repair. This seems extremely expensive for a problem thats more of nuisance than something serious that needs immediate attention. Any ideas where I can get a cheaper repair or perhaps repair it myself? $400 is ridiculous when it's their own design flaw. I have never mishandled this laptop. It has never fallen, been submerged in water, or sustained any other sort of hardware damage. And apparently, I cannot get an extended warranty because the original warranty has expired and I cannot purchase a Care Package because ""my laptop is not in good condition."" Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

Hi all,Hopefully I can get somewhere with this one-- my mom recently asked me to fix her laptop (it'd been knocked over and one of the hinges broke) and while I was able to replace the broken hinge, I've noticed that I can't turn the laptop on anymore. After opening it up a few hours ago and taking a closer look at it, it looks like the power button board is either disconnected or somehow missing (as in it may have broken off at some point during the repair process, because I realized that the reason why the power button wasn't working was that it wasn't connected to anything. (Here's what I'm seeing.)As the subject says, the laptop in question is an HP 15-bs234wm. While I know why it's not powering on, what I don't know how how to remedy this.

Hi, My HP Envy 17-ae103na has broken while still under warranty through no fault of my own. After 9 months of opening and closing the display the left hinge completely detached and broke away, causing the screen to completely detach from the aluminum backing on the left side. I was under the impression a £1,000 HP laptop would last longer than 9 months; being a loyal customer having only bought HP in the past. I was wondering how I would go about having the hinge and screen re-attached, as I mentioned it is still under warranty. I can no longer use the product as a mobile laptop as further opening an closing of the display will only cause more damage. I am in possession of all the pieces that broke away.Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hello, The right hinge on my HP ENVY x360 seems to have broken. If I try to close it, the screen begins to separate from its casing near the hinge, which seems to be loose. This is quite unfortunate because I've only had the notebook for about two years and have treated it very gently; it rarely leaves my desk at home. I've heard that the inner casing is made of plastic and that many others have had this problem. I'm led to believe that this product was shoddily made despite a sturdy appearance. Even more unfortunate is the fact that the warranty has expired. While not completely inept, I don't feel entirely comfortable ordering the parts and repairing it myself, so I'd like to know what options are available for repair. I'd like to speak to an HP representative, if possible.  Thanks for your time.

I am beyond angry at this point of owning an HP laptop. This is my second Envy Laptop in four years past. The first laptop experienced a broken left hinge and the entire screen came apart, exposing the inside. The Geek squad argued with me about this issue and insulted me by insisting I mishandled or dropped the unit, which was totally not true. They gave me a ridiculous price to attempt to have the unit fixed and suggested trashing it and buying a new unit which I did. That was January 17, 2019. Two weeks ago the NEW computer, another Envy HP Laptop had the very same issue occur. The left hinge literally cracked exposing my left screen side. I am furious, disappointed, and very angry that HP has not corrected this issue to protect us as consumers of their product.  I can not afford another $1500, especially at this stressful and difficult time that most of us are experiencing.   I need help and some sympathy and support from HP.  I have attempted to call and even send EMail to no avail. Please, read my post and offer some sort of remedy in helping me get my computer back to use.

Computer screen broke when opened because the hinge pulled out and every time you move it breaks a little more!!! This is terrible!! Called a repair shop and told them what happened didn’t ever tell them what brand I had but they told me what it was because he sees it all the time!

My laptop fell a few months a back and the placstic outer case on one side broke and that subsequently caused the screen to become disconnected on that side. It works (i think- lights up when i put it on ) but will not turn on (the screen) the wire that connects the screen to the base is broken and the screen is hanging on one hinge.

Hi, my laptops hinge has recently broken. this is through no fault of my own as i believe, as i never move my laptop, and i have left it open for the last 2 days due to myself being scared of opening/closing the lid as it makes a horrible clicking sound along with the hinge detaching from the bottom left corner of the screen. my laptop is working fine except the hinge. i have read through the other discussions and found out that most people that bought their laptops 3-4 years ago are experiencing this, my laptop was bought in 2013. I tried to superglue the screws together as i do not have the time to get my laptop fixed or even afford to fix it right now, as i know HP will try to charge me a ridiculous amount for such a tiny job as i am a student and have exams in 2 months. What do i do? i would fix the part myself but i cannot find any replacement parts for my laptop. I believe this is not fair for me as i did not even drop the laptop or even moved it around much as i am always doing work on my desk. My battery doesnt even lock on the same side of the hinge that broke, thats how out of place it is.

The hinge on my HP pavilion gaming 15-cx0056wm laptop has broken and the bezel has cracked after 10 months of use. I have not dropped the pc or put it under undue stress. I have only opened and closed it. HP support said the could fix it for $400, since this is a $600 pc I think that is silly. I've seen other people with this problem so it seems like a manufacturing error. How should I fix this?

I received a response dated July 11- I  had posted months ago about my laptop screen falling apart.  I got a stock response from Omar-E who said he was going to refer my problem to someone. Now I got an e-mail saying there was a response, but I searched the link they sent me and I see NO response.So- my laptop was in for a fix in the first few months i  dropped it. They supposedly fixed the crack by replaing the entire case.  When it was returned the screws came out and the top started separating. There were little black dots that were supposed to cover the screws, bit one fell off and there was no screw under the little cover. Guess the repair person was too busy to put the screw back. So I had to return it again, and this time they said there was a part that had to be ordered, and it took weeks to get the laptop back. Then a few months later, everytime I lifted the laptop you could hear something rolling around inside. I called and reported this and got a claim number.  Then one day it stopped rolling around and so I thought whatever was loose just got hung up on something inside and would stay there. So, I cancelled the claim. i also did not want to give my laptop up for a liong time again. Then the clicking started. Everytime you would open the laptop it would make a cracking noise. Then the screen started separating on the corners and then at the actual hinge. If laptops can be made that snap apart, they should beable to make one that stays together. I was always afraid to open my laptop. I felt like I was doing something wrong, but you have to move the screen to open the laptop.This would be made worse by being told that $250 will fix the problem.  I asked the rep if HP had addressed this obvious problem, because I  would not pay for a repair for the same quality that i have now since it will obviously not last for over a year, and then I can pay for the repair again??? Excuse ME!My former HP laptop separated. It was larger and had a thicker and stronger case, but the hinge on one side still separated. That one was not ever dropped. so what is up with the laptops coming apart???? I posted that I fixed mine with Sugru. I got it from Target.  I would like to believe that HP is somehow concerned about my problem, but despite this stock answer online - I have not had any response from a real person. But, the email that I did receive asked me post Kudos for the response that i never received. What a joke

What is HP's answer for the hinge issue's like the one I am experiencing? I understand it is a common issue for HP.

So, my laptop (Envy x360) broke yesterday. Left hinge popped and cracked the bottom left side of my screen.  I cried. I'm a college student and use my laptop almost daily. I paid a lot of money and have owned it for a little less than a year and a half. I contacted Hp and was transfered 3 different times and kept being told that my warranty had expired and that they needed to transfer me to the correct department, three different times. I was on the phone for about an hour and while I was on hold to speak to the 4th rep, I got hung up on. I am super upset.The laptop seems to work okay still, however the touchscreen is no longer functioning. After doing some research within these forums, it appears that this is a very common issue with these laptops and them all having faulty hinges that give out. I have sent an email to Hp, not even sure if it went throught, I never received any confirmation or anything. Does anyone out there have any tips on how to get through Hp phone support and just ask for the right department?

						Just after 13 months of buying my new HP Envy, the right hinge broke. There were no falls/accidents. This laptop is my work equipment. Warranty expired a month ago. I am very very frustrated at this and I am wondering whether if I leave it as it is will lead to further damage to my laptop. I will think again before buying an HP next time!

I didn't really notice this problem until a few months after having this computer. I have been making bi-weekly payments on this wonderful laptop since fall of last year through a local Circuit World. I soon started to notice that even if I opened the laptop slowly or gently, there was this awful cracking noise coming from the computer. I had gotten used to it and assumed it was a minor thing, as I have experienced with other laptops in the past. It wasn't until I had run my hand over the left corner of the laptop that I noticed that the bottom cover had been starting to ""pop out"" or at least not connect itself correctly to the top cover as the right side did.  I have never once damaged this laptop via tossing, dropping or rough handling. This computer is very expensive and takes a lot from my budget, so I have made sure to take the most absolute delicate care of this computer, including handling and virus protection. Unfortunately, with this computer now being excessively harder to open than it should, and the damage that I'm afraid this left hinge is causing, it has become more than just a ""little"" problem to me, and I fear that it will only worsen over time. I've noticed that in another forum, a customer had their HP ENVY replaced, but I'm wary that I cannot recieve the same treatment because of my purchase throught Circuit World. I will talk to the employees at Circuit World about getting it fixed or getting a replacement if that applies to me, but for now I'm looking to see if there is a simple, easy fix to this problem, at least one that could save time or money because the left hinge problem seems relatively easy to fix, I'm just not going to take chances with damages to my own computer. This also seems to be a problem that isn't solely happening to me, but very many other HP ENVY 17 owners. Thank you!

Hello,The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner and two screws fell out together with some small, plastic pieces.I had purchased the laptop on October 16 2018. I literally moved the laptop 360 and the hinge broke. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way, rather taking really good care of it. I never thought this would happen in the middle of my term. If you can help me with this it will be great. thank you in advance

I bought my autistic grandson a laptop in December 2017 as he is into coding. Suddenly he found he couldn't open or close the top without the frame around the screen on the left side from separating from the main top.  I was going to see about getting it fixed, but that wasn't going to happen. People who are autistic have lots of problems dealing with sudden problems. I've found that the hinges on HP laptops are defective and that if HP fix it, that will cost a lot. If I could afford it I would just buy him a new laptop. But I can't. Right now he has the top open so it is usable. He uses this computer all the time for school work; writing codes in programs; connecting with others online; and it's the way he calms himself. He goes to it as soon as he gets home from school. He uses it when life is stressful. He takes it with him when visiting the home of others. It helps him adjust to new surroundings. Another problem is the anxiety that separating him from the computer in order to send it some place to get it fixed. I wish I had known about this problems, then I wouldn't have bought this. I have had other HP laptops, desktops and printers with no problems at all. I agree with others that HP should fix this problem without charging customers since they have known of this problem for years.

Have the exact same problem as @Shaun10 except on a 17"" HP laptop of my husband's.  Bought on Black Friday 2017 from Best Buy, although it was received about 2 weeks later, so early December.  Now it's just a couple weeks over warranty and the hinge has stripped away from the base.  This is totally ridiculous that this has been a known flaw for many years, yet it is still happening.  Was told that it would cost about $300 to fix ""properly"", almost as much as what the original laptop costs.
 
This unit has never been dropped and is used by a 66 yo guy who almost never takes it out of the house and takes very good care of it.  This is a very well known design flaw that happens due to no fault of the owner, I feel it should be fixed at no cost, especially so close to the warranty time.  Had I read about this before I purchased, I would never have bought HP.  If anyone can help me get this fixed at no, or very reasonable cost it would go far toward good customer service.  I am not interested in a coupon to buy a new computer because if that's the case I don't want another HP computer.

I have the same problem, and the longer I wait for any assistance, the more problems occur - now the right hinge is also dropping. The screen came out but I pushed it back in.I was hoping there would be assistance from HP since this appears to be a common problem with the Envy convertible but I guess perhaps I should give up as well. No one has responded to my original post and I am out of the US so places to fix it are few and expensive.  This was a gift - and I doubt I can afford a new computer here. Such a huge disappointment - for a defective item.  It would be really nice to hear from someone from HP

SERIOUS KNOWN DESIGN FLAW with ENVY x360Unfortunately, a broken hinge on the HP Envy x360 is not an uncommon issue faced by its users (see list of similar posts) and I am no exemption. When closing the laptop (as it is intended) from 90°s the screen pops and detaches from its casing. The hinge appears to have separated internally due to a design flaw present in the laptop model.The laptop has been used delicately throughout and when used like a tablet - seemingly a design advantage, the product failed to meet satisfactory quality. Although out of warranty by less than a year, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 makes it an implied term of the contract I have with HP that goods be as described, fit for purpose, and of satisfactory quality. When contacting customer services to explain that the issue faced, I am met with a quote of over £300 for repair with the best discount of 15%. It is simply unfair to demand repair costs in any sum due to a design flaw faced by many users. Various posts have suggested that HP looked to a remuneration scheme or recall, however, I was unable to confirm this. Similar posts regarding the same design flaw: The most prominent post is: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinge-on-Envy-x360/m-p/...  Others:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-screen-popped-out...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/td-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-hinge-on-HP-Envy-x360/t...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-13-hinge-issue/td-p/79...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Quality-issues-with-Envy-x360-...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Breaking-hinge-on-HP-EN...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x... Images of the flaw (which appear to be modified to become removed):       With HP Customer services being unable to assist, the best I can hope is to have to escalate to an ombudsman or further. I am extremely disappointed with HP and the laptop itself, I had a 2-in-1 convertible laptop in the past that has served me for over 4 years from a different brand [Content Removed]. I decided to save up my money for a better and newer version (or so I thought). I have taken great care of this laptop, there are no scratches, the screen is without any faults and yet by using it for an intended purpose of a tablet - it falls apart as if I tried to convert a standard laptop into a tablet.

My right hinge connecting the screen and keyboard together has broken. It cracked a couple weeks ago after normal use but completely broke when I opened the screen yesterday and will not close anymore. As the screen is open, I can no longer move the screen to get rid of glare, etc. without the screen cover popping open and me having to pop it close again. I have tried using the virtual assistant to get a replacement part with no help there and searching the website for replacement parts with again no help. My PC is out of warranty but I need to get this fixed as soon as possible because I am an online student and rely on my PC.

Left hinge seems to have seized up and been pulled out of the mounting on the case, which has caused the case to start bulging... I'm getting the impression that I'm hardly the first to have this issue. Out of warranty, so if there's a way to contact HP about it, I am unaware of it; the only options I see are buying phone support, or the virtual agent which just ends up with telling me to buy phone support.

My left hinge on my HP Envy x360 broke recently.  I cannot find a computer repair service to fix it.  This computer was only two years old when the hinge broke, and it rarely left my computer desk.  Literally carrying it from the desk to the table caused the hinge to break.  It is a very nice laptop otherwise, but this issue appears to be a common problem from what I have read on the forum and what certain computer repair services have told me.  It is a plastic on metal design, apparently.  I would like HP to fix it, as it is an obvious design flaw.

Hi,The hinges on my laptop broke last fall when I believe the device would have been in warranty, however, I did not know I got this for just for buying an hp product. (The laptop is still fully usable, with no crake’s; the screen just does not stand up). I thought the warranty was an extra purchase which I did not make, so  I never looked into hp fixing it. Rather  I went down several other avenues to get it fix and they all to say they could not. Is their anyway I could prove it broke during warranty to have it fix by hp now? If not what can I do with/ how to recycle this new and useable laptop so it does not create waste. I would obviously love to still use this device, but I’m not sure what to do now if no one can fix it.

There are clearly major problems with HP's design and manufacturing of hinges.  After having the hinge break on my ENVY 15 Notebook this summer, HP repaired it. Just a few months later, it broke again (despite extremely careful use throughout the time that I used it). This is the second HP product my family has purchased that have had hinges break.

I have brought it to a repair centre (not HP) and they could not really fix it, except for completely replacing big parts of the laptop, which would cost a lot of money. The repair centre guy also told me this is a problem with more HP laptops of this kind, and that I should send a message to HP because they should fix this problem if it is this common - even out of warranty.The laptop is out of warranty, but it was a very expensive laptop and I would expect the hardware to last longer than 2 years.I hope you can help me.Kind regards,Niels

So far, this has been my favorite laptop and I would like to continue to use it, if only I could get the hinges and the case fixed. It is so bad now that It will not open fully anymore, it's currently unusable. To my knowledge it has not been dropped or mistreated in any way. It simply became difficult to open one day, like it was stuck and the problem got worse each time. Please let me know if this is still a fixable issue? I realize it's getting old but it was still working well for me until this case and hinge problem happened. I would love to be able to continue using this wonderful laptop. Thank you in advance for any help or advice you may have for this problem.

My HP Pavillion Gaming laptop started showing cracks just some 9 months after I bought. The bezel was slowly peeling off and now its completely broken. I did not expect this to happen and that's why I never checked it when it was under warranty as well. The back hinge is now broken. I just don't understand how something like this that really seems to be a defect in the laptop design. I see many people have faced this issue and I don't understand why its been designed like this as well?? My warranty has now expired. Where can I get this repaired and how much will it cost?I know from searching this site that I am not alone with this same problem. Isn't there anything that HP can do to repair this ?

Hello, My sister's HP Envy x360 laptop broke from the left hinge 2 weeks after her warranty expired. The same thing happened to my HP Envy x360, with the left hinge breaking off a few weeks post-warranty expiration. My laptop was repaired for free, with my sister's laptop requiring an additional cost. We tried to ask why there was discrepancies in service, but were left with no answers. Regardless, 9 months later we decided to just pay for the repair as it was clear HP wasn't willing to explain the discrepancy or offer alternative solutions. There was an offer of the cost to be reduced up to 35% for the repair, and I had let the HP representative know we would be able to send in the laptop at the end of June, as that's when my sister finished her online school. We were given the deadline of July 2nd, and we reached out on June 27th, June 30th, and July 15th. It is now July 26th, and I really want to send in my sister's laptop as I know it takes a 4-6 weeks and will likely take longer due to Covid, but my sister starts her online school in September and we really need the laptop repaired. It's already been a year, and we obliged by HP's conditions. Since messaging the HP representative as led to no response, I'm hoping that posting this issue will allow another HP representative to reach out to us. With having to deal with a two laptops with the same broken hinges, no explanations by HP representatives, and the sudden lack of response from HP, this has been one very exhausting situation. I would really just like to send in my sister's laptop to get it fixed ASAP. Thank you.

Hello, I reached out to the support community about a year ago, for a broken hinge on the left side of my HP Envy x360. An HP escalation executive reached out to me, and we were able to resolve my issue free of cost once I had sent in pictures of my laptop. I would like to point out, that the laptop was less than 1.5 years old at the time, I had not done anything to it, and my previous 2-3 HP laptops also had broken left hinges. In my previous post, I also mentioned how my sister bought an HP Envy x360, two weeks after I bought mine. Similarly, two weeks after my laptop screen came apart, hers started breaking apart too. Now this was shocking as she keeps her laptop on her desk all day, and doesn't even take it to school as I do mine daily. The fact that her laptop started falling apart at the same timeline as my own, and that previous our previous HP laptops also broke with the left hinge, makes me think this may be a hardware issue on the fault of the company. Now, we have been reaching out to HP since October/November 2019, and have constantly been given unsatisfactory solutions. First, we were told to call HP, which costs a decent amount of money that did not seem plausible for a hardware issue. 6 months later, we reached out again, to which the person we spoke with was a different individual who keep ignoring my questions, and at most offered us a 35% discount without even asking for pictures.  This was highly disappointing as my laptop was repaired for free, AFTER the executive had seen the pictures. Secondly, it was to no fault of our own that the laptops began to fall apart, as mentioned before my sister does not even move her laptop from her desk to her bed, so how did her screen start breaking apart? Thirdly, I would be willing to pay a bit to get it fixed, but it is highly disappointing as we paid over $1000 for the laptop, and within the span of a month gave this company $2500 of our business, and much more over the last 12 years. As well as, my sister is in high school and I am a university student, we cannot afford to pay +$300 for repairs when we spent $1200 on the laptop itself, individually. As for ignoring the question, the individual wouldn't answer why mine was repaired for free, why I couldn't speak to the executive as before, and why he wasn't even asking to see the condition of the laptop. He had also mentioned that my sister's laptop was out of warranty and thus cannot be repaired for free. But when we first reached out it had only been out of warranty for 3 months, and mine was also out of warranty, yet it was still repaired free of charge. Now it's obviously been much longer, but only because we haven't been able to come to an agreeable solution. I am upset and disappointed with HP for the lack of clear communication and understanding, I am open to any suggestions on how to repair this laptop with low cost, or any other ways I can reach out to HP and speak with as escalation executive as I hope they will be more understanding. Any suggestions are appreciated and welcome. Thank you.

I have an HP ENVY x360 with a broken left hinge. I have had my laptop for LESS than 2 years, and the broken hinge has progressively gotten worse with pieces of the hardware breaking off and I am also now unable to close my laptop at all.  At first I thought it was something I may have done, as my previous HP laptop had also broken from the left hinge (however I was still able to use it for 6 years through multiple repairs, but it was also only a fraction of the price of an HP ENVY x360). However, my sister bought her HP ENVY x360 on the exact same as I did. Her left hinge began to loosen a week after mine did. She keeps her HP ENVY x360 on her desk at all times.  With both our left hinges breaking, and my previous HP laptop left hinge breaking, I'm beginning to think it's a manufacturing issue. I have no idea what I should do to fix it, where I can take it, and I am beyond upset if I have to pay a tremendous amount (which I could use for a cheaper laptop that'll last me longer) to fix this issue, when this laptop itself already cost more than $1200.  As a university student working minimum wage, I cannot afford to pay high amounts to fix this laptop. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should do or where I can take it? I'm at a total loss.  P.s. I'd like to get my laptop fixed before the beginning of September as I need it to take notes in class and do my assignments. Much appreciation for anyone that can help! Thank you!

Light use.  Based on the large number of HP customers that are experiencing this same issue, I can't help but to think this is a HP ENVY x360  hinge manufacturing defect. Do you have a system in place to resolve this or am I on my own and left with a defective laptop?I would be very grateful to hear from you!

Poor hinge design causing case to crack. I had this laptop repaired 6 months ago because the hinge froze up causing a crack to develop on the left side of the top case. Sure glad I had the extended warranty. Now the right side has the same issue.  It is obvious that HP has known for sometime that they have a hinge problem and has done nothing to correct the problem. I really like the x360 but !!!!!

TLDR; I think my laptop hinge or corner of my screen has broken on its own accord. How do I get it fixed? This morning when I opened my laptop, I heard some clicking sounds and found:1. The bottom right corner of my screen had popped out slightly.2. The right hinge wasn't level with the left hinge.3. The bottom right corner of my screen is slightly discoloured and has tiny bubbles.4. I can't move my screen over 120 degrees because my screen bends so much that I fear that it'll break. Yesterday, my laptop was fine (I could bend and close it perfectly ).My laptop NEVER leaves my desk unless I need to print something (which is rarely). I honestly haven't been rough with it or done anything that might cause this to happen. Certainly nothing to warrant the screen to come apart. I can't believe it's broken! I know my 3 year warranty period hasn't ended yet. How can I get this issue fixed ASAP? I'm starting uni next month and I can't be using a faulty laptop. I also can not afford to buy a new laptop right now. I'm quite desperate. Please help me.

I live in France and ordered a HP Envy mid of May. The hinges started to have problem around July, only 2 months later. I didn't contact the customer service immediately because I needed my computer everyday (I'm unemployed, job searching and passing interviews several times a week). A few days ago, in August, it became more and more difficult to close the laptop: the cracking noises of the hinges made me fear that the cover or the screen would crack too.  And when I close it fully, the screen reopen a little bit. I contacted the customers service, but was told that this is not covered by the warranty: it would cost me 350€, 30% of the price I paid for the computer only 4 months ago ! I always considered HP as a solid and reliable brand (my close uncle was even an employee), and felt betrayed and shocked to be in this situation where I should pay so much (especially while being unemployed) for something that is under the responsability of the company (I'm not asking for a favor for something that I would have broke by myself). Looking at this forum and over the Internet, it seems like a common problem with HP computers.I would expect HP to either:- fix my hinges (in a way that the issue doesn't come back in 2 months)- replace the computer (in case this one had a specific stronger default on the hinges) to avoid the problem to reappear every 3 months. I believe that under a 1 year warranty, hinge should be covered, otherwise it's raising doubt on the quality of the hinge if the brand expect it to break before a year ? Thank you

Everything has been working well until the las weekend.  I closed the screen and left the house and when I came back tried to open and the right hinge was broken, the screen is still intact, but some screws fall down. I have seen alot of posts with the same issue. Is HP doing anything to help fix this?My warranty has expired, and I don't want to spent money for something that might be HP fault.

The hinge failed on my 13"" hp envy laptop computer and I have been trying to find either a replacement or something thatwould work as a display.  It appears that you must deal with China in getting a replacement screen.  What I have found out also is that this market is filled with scam artists saying that they have a screen.  As it turns out I purchased from one and haven'theard from him since. I think I may be out $75.00.  Can anyone help me out.

The screen hinges and plastic cover on my notebook is broken after a year of use. It started giving me cracking sounds earlier but not is totally broken with plastic bits lying around and the screws holding the screen to the hinges off. It seems the plastic parts for the screws are broken on the screen side so no means of re-securing the screws back to hold the screen to the hinges

Hi all,My sons 13 month old  laptops hinge has just come loose and is pushing the screen out, the screen hasn't cracked yet. I have noticed that this seems to be a common issue with these laptops and was wondering if any one was able to get theirs repaired out of warranty  under Consumer Law. He was also having issues with 3 of his keys and now they are not working at all, don't know if its related. The warranty information on their web site was also wrong by about a year. I have put in a dispute about that, even though it is still out of warranty.

There is a problem with my laptop's left hinge. I opened  my laptop asusual and used it normally , while closing i was really shocked to see the bolts of the Left hinge to be dropped and I was unable to close the screen fully.It started to form a gap between the dispaly screen and the backpanel steel case. When I try to close or open it the gap seems to be increasing eventually and It was visible that hinge has been broken. It is sad to see these type of things for a laptop which is expensive. I reached to near by store regarding that but No luck. They said that they will not repair this kind of things and continues to say that.l, If they do it anyhow they can't guarantee to handover me the PC as before and they suggests that to through it somewhere and buy a new one.. It is the only HP recognised service centre in my city.How a Service center guy say like that and why there is No service for this things.. He also mentions that we need to replace the whole back panel and doesn't guarantee about the touch screen after reparing..and it may cost around almost half the price of the laptop in indian currency.. Does it cost that much just for a hinge loss which has also happened itself.I mean without dropping or hitting it... Kindly please help me regarding this, please as i am stuck in a difficult situation of work from home and laptop issue. And the experience of mine with this expensive model of hp has made me believe not to buy any product of hp anymore.

Hello, I am seeking help for a similar issue. I have HP Envy Laptop 13-aq0...
My hinge has broken on the right hand side when viewed from the front & the black plastic pieces have fallen out.
So now when the lap top is opened it separates from the base but can be clicked back into place.
 
I have noticed the newer generation of Envy has a completely new design preventing this from happening.
 
Please advise. Could I get this part from HP & replace the part myself as my laptop is out of warranty. (expired 06/2020) 
Kind regards

Hello, I purchased a HP envy 13 last October 2019 bundled with a 3 year additional care pack. The care pack does not include accidental damage but does include all the regular warranty conditions as far as I am aware. Around January 2020; I started to hear crunching when ever I open and close the laptop. A few weeks a go a piece of plastic came out of the hinge area. The hinge has considerably deteriorated and sometimes when opening the laptop the metal case can be popped out of its clips. I did not drop or bang my laptop; I always make sure I am very careful with it. I have seen videos online of people with the exact same issue so it seems to be a fault of design. Therefore I ask; Is the repair of the hinge covered by my care package/warranty? Again please note that the issue is most certainly not as a result of accidental damage. Thank you.

Hello, The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke or got stuck, the screen popped loose down in the corner and split from the lid. My warranty ran out in August 2021. This happened without any drop, mishandling or misuse. I have noticed that a lot of people have apparently faced this issue with this particular product line. I paid around INR 79,999( roughly USD 1100) for this laptop and a little over a year, this issue has come up.  Obviously, there is a major design/durability flaw with the hinge. HP must offer an extended warranty for this issue if it is so common.     Kindly provide me with a solution for this issue. My laptop was purchased in India and I am currently living in Berlin, Germany. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Purchased through Amazon and it is beyond the return date. When I first started using my laptop in NOV 2019, I noticed the hinge was stiff and didn't move freely and stop at any angle, like my old HP Laptop. A gap developed and I could close it if I snapped the right side then the left side. Now that doesn't work and the bottom half of the case has a crack and I can see screws that must have broken out of alignment with the holes where they belong. Last night my screen was completely bright and today it is all dim. I can't change the brightness. Soon the power cord will not be able to plug into the hole, It is partially blocked so I have to force it in.  I use a wireless internet connection.  Everything works well except the hinges, dimming and brightening, and plugging in the power cord to recharge.

Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue  with an out of warranty 2 year old envy 360x laptop.  The left hinge has apparently broken and the screen at the bottom of the frame has separated from the back and I'm unable to close (physically not shutting down).  It popped for months before a small piece of plastic fell out and now I'm unable to close and it only has a small range when using the display.  Since out of warranty have search hp for help with this problem and have contacted the local repair that is suggested on hp's site with no luck -- when called the company that hp suggests was told they don't do laptops.  Obviously this is a design flaw and no fault of mine since not abused in anyway.  I would like to repair and have talked to numerous computer repair services being more confused now that when I started,  you think with the number of posts regarding this problem you'd be able to find something on hp's site -- runs great and not ready to purchase another so iI'd like to weigh my options.

I recently purchased (November 2020) and Envy X360 from JB Hi Fi. With normal use the left hinge and screen has just let go and now started to come apart. Naturally I took it back to JB HI FI but they claimed I had rotated the screen to far, until I pointed out this hinge was designed for 360 degree use, then they claimed it was dropped or I had forced the hinge and said I would need to pay to have it fixed.  None of the above is true.  I spoke with an independent computer repair who said this was a well know fault of the HP and I should talk with them directly - does anyone know how to contact HP to discuss this issue? I have tried the phone but there is no  options  for warranty or fault hardware issues and it just hangs up on you??

My 17t-n100 will not power up. When plugged in, the Power/Charging LED next to the power jack does not light up. I have done all the home diagnostics suggested, also tested/replaced the AC adapter and AC power jack. Same result, will not power up, LED does not light. I therefore suspect it needs to be repaired. The original warranty is expired, so I know I would have to pay for it to be repaired. I would like to have it serviced. I have been unable to contact an HP agent directly through the website. I tried contacting my local authorized repair facilities, listed on HP's site, and have gotten no response. Not surprising given the disruptions and increased demand for service right now. I'm hoping someone from HP can reach out to me and help me get my computer repaired. Thank you.

I am so upset with HP right now I could scream. I have bought many hp computers and laptops through the years. I have had the same exact issue with my last three laptops and now my newest one. The first two were old and lasted a very long time before it happened so I was okay with purchasing a new one but these last two lasted only 13 months, right outside their warranty and I can’t afford to keep doing this. I believe you are selling faulty product. All four laptops have broken/or come apart at the right side hinge. When I bought the 3rd one I did not buy the hardware warranty because your products have been so dependable and lasted a long time. Shame on me it only lasted 14 months and could not be repaired so in January 2018 I had to buy another one. Spent over $1500.00 at Best Buy, with virus protection and geek squad service. I even asked the salesman if this could possibly happen again and he told me “no ma’am, they have correct that issue with the new ones” so again I did not buy the hardware warranty. Now, I am one month out of warranty and this one has done it again. This is so not fair and I cannot afford another one. My husband is dying of lung cancer and I try to work from home to take care of him. Can you please help me??? It is an HP Envy Sharon Delaney

The 2 hinges broke on my hp envy x360. You can still see the cheap plastic on the screws suggesting awful product design. I’ve seen many other posts like mine. Should HP cover the cost of the repair? I still don’t know if it might have damaged my screen has the hinges popped on the screen side and separated it from the top cover. The laptop was never dropped and barely moved trough its whole lifespan. For a product that expensive, the hardware shouldn’t be breaking under 3 years.

  I was just using my laptop in bed, and adjusted the screen (quite gently) as normal. The left hinge appeared to break, and the inner part of the case is separating from the outer part. I worry that if I keep using it, the whole thing will break. I don't know if I have a warranty (it was a gift from my mother, who bought it from Currys PC World under a year ago).

I also have a problem with the hinge forcing the screen apart from the laptop. It was also purchased in 2019, could I also be contacted, please? Seems these hinges are a faulty design. My screen has separated from the laptop and it won't close properly. Continuing to use it like this is going to result in it breaking further, for sure. I'm surprised the screen hasn't cracked.

I noticed earlier this week that the left hinge on my HP ENVY x360 was broken when I went to close the lid and felt a bit of resistance. When I went to check I noticed that I felt a bit of an unnatural bulge near the area of the display near the left hinge and that the display was slowly coming off near the left side. Thankfully I noticed this problem before I fully closed the lid because I'm afraid that if I go to close the lid fully, my display screen/monitor will get shattered.  It's hard to notice but in this picture, the display is slowly coming off the lid. At 1st after noticing this problem, I decided to go and get a hinge replacement. But, after doing research, I saw that most hinge replacements cost approximately $300. I am a student and I need this computer to do almost all my assignments and I can't spend $300 dollars on fixing this laptop.  Also, I believe this to be a design flaw because I had seen multiple different posts where people had a similar issue to mine  also in regards to a HP ENVY x360. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinge-on-Envy-x360/m-p/...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Hinge-on-Envy-x360-Conv...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broken-Breaking-hinge-on-HP-EN...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Quality-issues-with-Envy-x360-...I hope that with this post HP could either repair my laptop  or point me towards a place that could without it being too costly and difficult.

It has not, and from the problems with hinges listed on here I think there is a design problem.

I've had a Pavilion x360 laptop for 8-9 months and it is still under warranty.  I was working as usual and tried to adjust my screen back a little to see the screen better when the hinge broke and forced the screen out, breaking it.  When I took it to back to Best Buy, the Geek Squad advised me that there was no use sending it out to HP for repair under warranty, as they would deny the claim under the warranty due to the broken screen (even though there was no damage/user error).

This product has 1 year manufacturer warranty plus 2 more years of warranty from costco. This model number is custom built for costco and not available outside costco.I am outside USA (currently in India). The HP service centre here says that the warranty on this product is not valid in India since this specific model is not released in India. They can't even fix it at our cost. The spare part (hinge) is not available in market. This means basically no fix for this problem although it appears to be a manufacturing defect (based on similar issues expressed by other customers.My suggestion to customer is that do not by HP laptop especially from Costco (or similar venders who have custom model build)I still have 8 year old Acer which has no such issue. I am surprised that reputed company like HP is selling defective products (even hig end models) like this!Can HP provide any help regarding this issue?

The right side screen hinge on my duaghters laptop has 'exploded' away from the lid of this laptop - this happened when she was opening the lid to use it - not exactly a strenuous 'use case'. Of course the warranty expired in August, regardless i have read that people are being charged for a fix even if thier computers are in warranty. A mounting mechanism of this type (3x 2mm screws into brittle plastic) for a laptop that is designed to have its screen folded over into tablet mode is completely unacceptable. It will very likely become a problem for ALL HP laptop owners of this design, i am sure there are many 1000's of them. Time to do some proper engineering so that this doesnt happen any more HP. What is your answer to those who are not willing to pay the 100's of dollars for the repair of a latent defect caused by poor design that occurs during use of the product in the manner it was advertised and sold to be used ?

Yeah Hi so the hinge on my refurb HP ENVY x360 - 15m-bq121dx broke off in the middle of me rotating it in the middle of class. The screen proceeded to fall on my desk and crack. Also, HP won't service it since it's out of warranty. Any tips on where to get either a replacement top part, a place to get it serviced, or someone I can yell at? It seems like blatant negligence on HP's part that their hinge broke within about 4 months of buying it, regardless of it being refurbished. I've loved the laptop and don't want this to ruin it for me, Thanks.

Had a hardrive professionally replaced.  Had been having slight concern over the lift on the left corn of the casing near the power button, but when I had the harddrive replaced to keep up with my images, editing and memory needs, they stated the casing was in peices.  They provided me with all othe parts and put the case back together best they could. Suggested I look at getting a new case.  My laptop is just out of warrantee. I am not hard on computer casing. I have a 15 year old dell that still has the stickers on the top side, and they are legible.  I am highly disapointed in the quality of the cases on the new HP's. For the amount of money I spent on this computer, I hoped for something for the long haul. I was quoted almost $250 for a replacement casing, due to the fact mine is teal. I read another thread that has been locked, that HP was correcting this issue for users as it was a design flaw. Am I able to get a replacement? I'd like to keep the teal casing color. Is the casing sent to the user, or do I have to send in my computer (hard to do since I make part of my living using it)? Thank you for any and all help.

I see there were many and recent complaints as late as August 2018 regarding this same issue I am now experiencing. I just bought this laptop almost exactly 1 year ago and I baby it! I opened the screen and heard a creak and loud pop sound to the left side of the computer and now the hinge is not working and broken. I have never dropped this computer nor do I put anything on it...not one scratch on it. What can be done or is there any recognition to this issue and willingness to fix it? thanks

This is not a question, just feedback to other HP customers. I am a Chartered Engineer. I NEED good quality equipment for my work. Over the last 10-12 years I have bought several of the top of the range Envy & pavillion laptops. They are always in the £1300 to £1500 region. The current one has lasted less than 2 years. The internal plastic has become embrittled and the screws which hold the hinges internally no longer have the plastic matrix with the brass bushes to screw into. Now whenever the laptop is open or closed, the internal hinges pop the cover off. Also, the screen has gone, all I can see are lots of horizontal multi-coloured lines. I now can only use it if I plug another monitor and keyboard into it.I wrote to HP last week. Their complaints dept phoned me today. It is out of warranty, they can repair it but I would have to pay, and yes, the repair would be carried out using the same plastic components which become heat embrittled after 12-18 months. The person who rang agreed with me that this was a very common complaint and that I was right to expect more than 2 years from a top end laptop.I said it would cost more than the laptop is currently worth to strip out the internals to replace the plastic carcassing. I asked why they wasted my time by ringing me. They said they just wanted to be polite.I have told them I will never buy HP anything again. I'll buy a new microsoft Surface Pro 7 next month.VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH HP.Save yourselves the hassle, don't pay the top prices for sub-standard equipment. Buy Microsoft or (and I hate to say this!) Apple.

Well, after doing a quick search, it seems like I am one of thousands of people that have experienced this massive structural failure of the HP x360 hinge system.  And like many of the accounts I have read, HP tried to blame their hinge design flaw on the buyers. I was sitting watching TV with the laptop on my ""lap"" which is exactly how it it supposed to be used, hence the name.  I would open it during commercials, then close it during the shows .  After about an hour, I went to open it and heard a massive CRACKKK ! The right hinge had broken free and literally came through the front screen.  Glass shattered off of the hinge and the screen was now only held on by the left hinge.  Upon examination, the 2-3 screws that are supposed to hold the hinge in place had somehow come out and had fallen out in my lap. Since there is no way for a user to access these screws, clearly it is a design flaw or quality control issue which should be addressed by HP. Spent 3.5 hours being given the America to India phone support shuffle being transferred back and forth and finally to a number that was a sales pitch for a medical alert bracelet.  Then here. My laptop is of course just a few months out of warranty,   But as I explained, if I am driving my car that is a few months out of warranty, and the steering wheel comes off in my hand, I will still expect the car company to address this clear design flaw or quality control issue.  From what I have read, this is a VERY common problem certainly not disclosed to me when I purchased the item.  Any solutions out there?

My HP Envy's left hinge broke and cracked my screen on March 16th (2019). I only purchased the computer last February and the warranty started Feb. 22nd (2018), and ended Feb. 21st (2019). I was hoping you could help me with how to go about repairing it since it is so close to the warranty date and I've only had it for a short amount of time. A repair man in the town I live in said that sometimes HP would fix these types of problems for a fraction of the price because it is so close to the warranty date and it seems to be a manufacturing error.

I am having trouble with the LCD back plate and hinge area on my HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-CX0058WM - I had purchased this laptop from Walmart Sept. 11 2019 and by Christmas of 2020 as I would close the lid you could hear little pieces of plastic snapping (I am 99% sure the noise is the threaded posts the screws to into), I have never dropped the laptop or forceful with it what-so-ever. As time goes by it is steadily getting worse and worse and more plastic is breaking and falling out of the screen, I am now afraid to even adjust the tilt of the screen.  EDIT: since it wont show my uploaded pics here is an imgur album;https://imgur.com/a/2XOUrA5 I have never had this happen to any other laptop I have ever owned, and the fact that it started happening two months out of warranty is ridiculous.

My hp envy 360 hinge broke only after 7 months of use. The right side hinge came out of the screen which was clearly very cheap and made out of plastic which even caused a crack on my screen. It was rarely ever on tablet mode hence no heavy pressure on the hinges. This is clearly a built issue and I'm not the first one to face it. My product is covered under extended warranty but they still refuse it fix it saying they do not cover accidental damages even though it is clearly stated on their website that they do. But this is actually a built quality issue and now they are refusing to fix it.

The warranty has also expired.The laptop doesn't close completely and the entire corner lifts up when opening and it doesnt let it open as well. This laptop has never been dropped and nothing fall over it. After reading about this problem i came across that it is a the problem of design itself. It would be nice if HP could help me with this problem.    Thank you in advance.

Had this device for about a year and a half.  The display hinge has gradually started failing, with first the glue separating between the display plastic surround, and here in the last few days the hinge beginning to wrench itself off.  No physical damage to the device, average daily usage of a couple hours.  Any options here?  Assuming the device is out of warranty, unfortunate a $1k laptop would break after such a short period of time. Have used HP devices for decades - they've always been well made.  Surprised to see the lower quality plastic and thin metal construction here failing so early...previous device lasted a decade and still has no issues.   Similar to other posts here and on the web:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Software-and-How-To-Questions/HP-Pavilion-Gaming-15-Hinge-Bro...

Was wondering if anyone out there can help....last week when attempting to open my laptop the right side hinge appears to be broken/frozen and is locking up. This is forcing the screen display bezel and the hinge cover  to separate from the touchscreen (http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c06941101.pdf page 19). As long as I don't attempt to open or close the screen the computer will continue to operate. If I do close and attempt to re-open the screen without supporting the bezel its going to crack the touch screen and then I'm going to have bigger problems than just replacing the screen hinges.  My questions are as follows:I've looked online in several online vendor stores to try and locate the exact hinge required to mend this problem but haven't had too much success. Several vendors list hinges for HP 15 inch laptops (with vague specs) but most of the vendors I questioned responded that their hinges would not work on a touch screen. Anyone out there know if the part  number listed on page 20 for hinges L52009-001 can be bought anywhere online other than at a local HP store? Also, I'm overseas in Germany using a US Model in a foreign country so locating parts during COVID is not an easy task. I will however be stateside next week so if anyone is aware of a HP outlet or store in the northern VA or southern Maryland district I'm open to suggestions?I've also looked at several options on YouTube for replacing HP hinges on touch screen on similar 15 inch PC's but my particular model is not available on YouTube. If anyone has completed this task before ..and and all advice is welcome. I think I can do this but obviously have some concerns over completely disassembling the screen and keyboard portion of the laptop ---- allot can go wrong!  Help....

My son purchased an envy 360 that in november 2017. Beginning of december the hinge broke on the left side. This  like a pretty common issue. Calls to support have been unhelpful. Can this be fixed? I have been purchases HP products for the last 10 years, and will not buy another one after this. 13 months is just not a resonable amount of time for a basic part like this  to fail. He is a college student and is not really in a position to replace this machine.  Took it to a ""computer doctor"" was told they would not be able to get the parts, or fix it.

I have a HP Chrome book.  It has developed a crack on the top plastic body near the hinges on both the sides.  It has neither fallen down nor hit by any hard surface. It is still under warranty. But the Hp service persons say it cannot be covered under warranty telling the following reasons.  they do not have past history for such damages.  (I have sent  link of the blog where many such incidents have been discussed) still they are not ready to accept/convince.they say it is not a functional failure but is due to unintentional damage.  I do not understand the difference between these two.they say if there is a mechanical failure in the hinge, it shall come out with out damaging the body. But for me it is very clearly developing pressure on the body when I am opening the tab, and the crack is getting opened up further.  Though the flange has not come out, it is getting opened very tightly.  I have sent the respective photographs to them. Still they are not interested to rectify the issue.

Like many others the right hand hinge has broken on my daughters HP x360 - Light use, hinge appears to have split, screw has dropped out and cannot close it. Month after 1 year warranty. Must be coincidence that loads of other people have the exact same issue rather than a basic design flaw with the hinge? Can someone tell me where I can get a replacement in the UK although it does seem a bit steep having to pay HP to repair something that they released that is fundamentally flawed. Do not buy this laptop model.

Hello.  I'm having an issue when opening my laptop.  Every time I lift the screen to open my laptop, there is resistance on the rights side of the laptop hinge that is starting to separate the screen from the casing.  This is the second laptop I have purchased with the same exact issue.  I ended up having to discard my last laptop since no one from HP was able to help me with this well known issue.  I replaced it with a new one, which was costly, but now it is starting to happen all over again.  Aside from this issue the laptop has been great.  This has become a frustrating issue since I depend on my laptop and I really don't have time to send it out to get fixed.  Can you please propose a solution??? Not sure if I am still under warranty.  In addition to this laptop, I have been a loyal HP customer and have purchased 3 other HP laptops  and a network printer for my family in the past 2 years.  I'd appreciate a fair resolution to this.

Dear Sir/MaamM Hinge of my laptop was broken in October 2018 for which I contact the hp team as the laptop was in warranty. They then sent an engineer after a month to check the issue who handled the laptop very badly. He took off a few things and places them back taking pictures but in the whole process he broke the screen. I told him the thing immediately and he assured me that it will be done in warranty. He then left and they kept me waiting for 4 months and suddenly last month they reject my case stating that hi he breakdown is not covered under warranty but no one is now paying attention to the screen the engineer broke himself. I even contacted your team through WhatsApp but they will simply ignore the screen part and reply with hinge is not covered in warranty. Okay, I will get the hinge repaired all by myself but what about the screen your engineer broke. I am not able to use the laptop from past 4 months . I have been talking to so many people but not getting any positive response. Please help me with this case, I already suffered a lot because of this.

My HP laptop that I bought online from Costco on 2022, Feb 07 , started breaking apart due to just everyday normal use upon opening and closing, The hinge is broken and tearing the whole frame apart. From what I see, this has been an ongoing issue in many of the HP laptops. I expected more. I spent $1300 on this computer. I have never dropped or done anything to it physically. I take very good care of it. I feel HP should stand behind their product, and fix or replace this for me. Eight months of owning and using just on a daily average basis, with no harm to it, it is just not right. I believe that I am covered by a two year warrantee. Please advise me on replacement process.Data:Purchased from Costco online on 2022, Feb 07Model : HP ENVY Laptop 17-cg1075cl.

We purchased this laptop in July 2020 for my son to use for school.  He went to close his laptop and a screw popped out of the left corner and the screen popped out of the same corner and cracked.  Now we can’t close the laptop in fear of damaging it any further.  But now it’s useless in its present condition.After reading all the other posts I see this is not an isolated incident.  Seeing as we purchased in July 2020, we are 5 months past the warranty.  This is very frustrating.  A laptop should last more than a year plus a handful of months.  On top of that, he is in college and needs his laptop for finals next week.  * An update to my post last night.  The laptop doesn’t work at all, doesn’t turn on even when plugged in.  How does this happen?  Working fine 1 minute, the next, a screw pops out and completely done.  A college student has enough stress already, with multiple projects due in the next couple of days on top of the upcoming finals.  This is a disaster.

Hi.The left hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner and two screws fell out together with some plastic ""crumbles"".I bought my computer from the HP store at the end of November 2017, exactly 1 year and 4 months ago and obviously the 1 year warranty is out. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way, rather taking really good care of it, but based on the tons of complaints around this same problem on this forum (and elsewhere) it is obvious that the hinge design is really poor.I am obviously very unhappy with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem.A computer in this price range should not break after just more than one year of normal usage!

I searched on Google and found that many people faced similar problem as I am right now. I am using a HP Envy 13 laptop, bought in March 2020. I've been taking great care of this laptop since then as it was my second laptop since high school and my uni life relies heavy on it. I was closing the lid and the bottom of the laptop cracked open. I tried to open the lid back up and then, the hinge popped out. When I approached HP support, they quoted me a service fee of about RM3.5K (approx. 3/4 of the initial price of the laptop) and proceeded to include a so-called ""Goodwill"" discount, reducing the price to RM2.3K. They also claimed that since my warranty had expired, it is advisable for me to go for this paid service, also saying that it is consumer's mishandling of device. In addition to this, they said that as my laptop is bought in another country, my device is not under global warranty.  Apparently, this hinge issue has been troubling many HP consumers since years ago. There are also claims that this is a manufacturer's problem where HP did not look into this hinge inadequacy and still continued to manufacture laptops with the same hinge. Anyone in the same predicament as mine or has any advice to how should I proceed from here?

Hello, My 17"" HP 250 G5 Notebook has had a noticeably rigid left hinge for two to three months now. However last week, as I closed the notebook, the hing made a few loud popping noises, spitting broken plastic pieces. Now, each time I close the laptop, I hear more cracking, and more plastic bits fall out of the case. The plastic surrounding the screen is warped drastically, and the metal hinge is exposed.  The screen and the screen case on the left side are no longer attached to the metal hinge. The problem seems to worsen each day, and I'm trying not to close or open the laptop but sometimes that's not an option. I have never dropped the laptop, and have consistently close it carefully since the hinge issues began. Given so many people have experienced the same type of issues, I'm confident HP can provide a viable fix. Thank you in advance.

My computer was purchased about a year ago. Only recently I have been unable to close and open my laptop.  The trim around my screen was pulled off by half of my left plastic hinge, the bottom half. The hinge is in great condition and will even clip back on, but the issue is internally. I don't know how to fix this. I am unable to open or close the lid for because of the broken connection on the left side, my plastic bottom hinge will not move, thus tearing my trim off the lid when I try to open or close.

  The left hinge has become detached/broken on the monitor side (HP Envy x360 Convert 15-bp100na). This, in turn, cause the bottom monitor frame to pop out.  Over the past few weeks, it got significantly worse as I am unable to close the laptop to prevent any further damage. The screen works perfectly fine and there are no cracks there.Originally it came as a surprise because the laptop was kept in a good condition, with no drops or bumps with very minimal use. However, after doing some research, it seems that this issue is rather a common issue, suggesting that this is a manufacturing defect.  Could you please inform me if there was any system in place to resolve and if so, what further actions can be taken? Many thanks!

My laptop that I bought in August 2018, started breaking apart due to just everyday normal use upon opening and closing, The hinge is broken and tearing the whole frame apart. My touch screen also broke . From what I see, this has been an ongoing issue in many of the HP laptops. I expected more. Spent a good deal more on this one, thinking it would last longer. I have never dropped or done anything to it physically. I take very good care of it. I feel HP should stand behind their product, and fix or replace this for me. One year of owning and using just on a daily average basis, with no harm to it, it is just unacceptable. I know the one year warranty ran out  as soon as I realized the problem was just going to get worse. But do they not have pride in their product, or own up to their defects in quality? I need some answers. I can't even get a number of email to actually speak with a live agent. The virtual assistant is absolutely no use in this situation. Has any one else had problems with these hinges. It seems to be more than just this model on the reviews that I have been researching. PLEASE, help me out if you have any info that could help. Thank you for your time

Hi, I bought a laptop (HP 17-BS0XX) from US (Chicago) in Feb 2018 and after 8 months of normal use (I am not a heavy user), one of its hinges have broken (hinge material is very poor). I have used many laptops of multiple brands but have never faced such issue. Another major issue I am facing is that I shifted to India soon after and HP India Support says that they don't have parts available and I should contact HP USA. HP USA says that I need to send the laptop to USA. All this implies that even for a MNC like HP, it makes no sense to buy devices if you spend time in multiple countries (note that India is a huge market for HP products). Dell is known for its customer service but I am really disappointed with HP. I am now with a laptop with broken hinge (otherwise it's great internally) and cannot use it.Please suggest. Regards,Rajesh

HiI am currently debating myself whether I should refund my Envy x360 or not because one of the hinges is crooked. It sits at an angle and generally when I fold the screen I hear creaking. I fear that the laptop might be broken in 3 months when the refund window is no more.What should I do? Is it a big enough problem that I should refund it (for the second time). I get the feeling that it is generally a gamble with quality control for these devices. This laptop also came with some soft plastic stuck in one of the USB hinges. Any advice is greatly appreciated  - Rasmus

I sware that I treat my laptop like treating one of my sons and I had a Lenovo that lasted 5 years with no problems at all. This hinge got broken and I tried to close the laptop but the whole frame also got broken after this hinge prevented me from closing the screen. I might be covered under the extended warranty that I bought but I don't understand the idea that a brand new laptop that should last at least 3 years won't last for 5 months!!!!I think that HP uses very cheap materials in their laptop comparing to other companies, the warranty department is offering to fix it which is really not satisfactory to me ! How can I fix and replace parts in a 5 months old laptop ! This is defective and I need a replacement , I have been asking to replace it with a new one but no one really understand and people in customer service treated me very rudely . They told me they they don't have 2 options to offer me and I should just accept any thing they say ! NO I shouldn't and you should understand that this is non sense and you guys have to be responsible for your products or you gonna lose all customers in the near future. I am going to post this on my facebook page and everywhere to warn people about HP laptops.

Hi my laptop Is somewhat broken. Only the screen itself is affected. Basically the bottom left connection between the computer and screen of my hp envy laptop. Has broken. This caused the screen itself to fracture and then the screen itself has gone dark. I had a personal warranty on the device purchased via amazon. But I forgot I had the warranty back when it broke. Then remembered after the amazon warranty had expired, which came with the laptop. I did however buy it specifically from a branch in the U.K.Where I live and the entirety of the transaction has taken place. Under EU law consumers are offered a two year guarantee in which sellers must repair or replace faulty or not-fit for purpose items, in addition this is trumped by the six year warranty in the UK legislation. The right applies to any goods sold in the UK. So online retailers must also comply. Under these I am covered to the best of my knowledge. i recognise the argument it may be categorised as user induced damage but as both myself and https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3381319 have noticed. After doing some research within these forums, it appears that this is a very common issue with these laptops and them all having faulty hinges that give out. Left hinge popped and cracked the bottom left side of my screen. I am in need of repairs on my laptop. Please can you be of assistance

Hello My HP Envy x360 right hinge came loose and the screen at right bottom corner is coming off while closing and opening the lid. This was purchased around July 2016 so there is no warranty any longer. I have only used the laptop with normal wear and tear. I would hoping the Envy would last longer. I have taken to a couple different computer repair places including the place where I purchased the laptop and estimated the repairs are around $300. This is a known issue with most HP laptops is the message I am seeing in the internet. I am not happy with this outcome and would like to have my Envy working so I can utilize other features and at least be able to confidently close the lid and not worry that I am causing more damage. HP - please provide a solution so I can get my Envy back working as normal again. ThanksRavi

We now have the exact same issue... Just out of warranty, screen is starting to separate from the case due to a broken hinge. We noticed it and have stopped opening the lid in an effort to prevent the screen from cracking. How is it every single HP Envy owner out there is having this problem and HP isn't owning up to the issue. Sounds like a lawsuit in the making. We've been loyal HP customers for a very very long time, but from what I'm reading here regarding how HP is ignoring this issue we may go a different route for our next purchase. It's sad really because they could own up to it, fix it for their customers, and come out better in the end because not only would they have fixed laptops, but they would create loyalty. 
 
Anyway, could someone from HP please let me know what our options are? Can we ship it in for repair, and if so what are the costs and turnaround times for doing so?
 
Thanks,
Mark

Hi, my laptop has been treated with the utmost care and is only a bit over a year old. When shutting down after my lesson, i heard a crunch and realise the left hinge was broken- shocking as it was on a table away from anything and anyone. The left corner of my screen was separating from the cover and the screen developed a crack! Again, zero impact on the laptop in any form! I've noticed this is an issue that many users have posted about. Has anyone received assistance from HP? My warranty has just expired and the repair costs are exorbitant. I purchased a high end model expecting it to last me well, using all my savings! So disheartened with the design flaw, which I was never aware of until I experienced it! Can anyone assist?

I think the hinge that was not properly installed did the damage to the LCD when it broke, so why should they not fix that damage too, as I said it was not cause by my. I am mad and disappointed at the service, because I have that laptop for maybe just a year and I really took care of it, but they are not willing to fix the problem that the hinge caused, which they admitted it was not properly installed. That is why I am writing here, so that you can help me and tell me if this is possible to fix under the warranty as it should be.

Hello, similar to the numerous descriptions listed on here under the same subject line, my HP Envy x360 15” lower right hinge separated from the screen this morning (side note: I spent at least a month looking into various brands and models specifically to avoid such a problem. HP has always been good to me with its desktop and laptop design, so I thought the Envy x360 would also be highly reliable.). It appears that two screws fell out, along with small bits of plastic - from what I can see, the plastic crumbs seem to be from the laptop cover, behind the screen. This was due to faulty hardware, not mishandling. While the laptop is out of warranty at this point, I see from other postings, that HP has recognized the design flaw and is willing to replace this at no cost. Please provide me with the contact information necessary to begin the repair process, and replace the flimsy plastic with a more durable material. Thank you!

Hi all, I purchased my HP Envy x360 somewhere around 2 years ago, and it's been consistently a reliable laptop for me up until now. Recently, however, when I opened my laptop, the right hinge broke, sending a few pieces loose, and now the screen is separating from the shell. From what I have heard, I am far from the only person to be dealing with this, but as my laptop warranty is expired, I am unsure what options I can take at this point, aside from purchasing a new computer altogether. Has anyone else had experience with this recently?

The laptop has automatically turned itself off many times when this happens. The high temperatures have caused one of the feet on the laptop to come off. What I have tried:Changing thermal profile in HP Command CentreKeeping all intakes and exhausts away from any surfaceFactory reset laptopUpgraded to latest version of BIOSWindows UpdatesHP Support Assistant updatesPlease advise.

I posted a question on 6/29/2020 in the morning and got a reply that afternoon from an HP Support Representative (with the orange logo, in a private email on this platform) asking for more information in order to help with a solution. I replied immediately and have not gotten any further communication despite two requests for an update. Have I been scammed? I would love to call and speak to a Representative, but cannot find a number to call. The automated chat also does not have an option to speak to a Representative. Many people are working from home and needing technical support; certainly this is a busy time. If my case cannot be resolved, can I at least get an update?

Right hinge is broken on HP Pavilion laptop; laptop will not close. Upper right hand corner lifts up when attempting to close the laptop. A small grey plastic piece about 1/4"" came off from inside... looks to be some sort of mounting pin break. Can some sort of glue that is computer friendly be used to clamp that corner shut?

I have an Envy 13. Yes it was from 2019 but it was still expensive enough that known faults should have been repaired. In late 2020, it had a new top cover as (like almost every Envy from that time period) under extended warranty. Now again the screen is flapping around like it is going to detach at any minute. My understanding is that this is not the hinges themselves but rather the fact that they are screwed into plastic, and I also have been told that this is no longer the case (which kind of proves that this is a known issue, aside from the various class actions underway and the fact that I have now been through two). I've read some people have had some help from HP with this issue but they aren't helping me. I have had an outlandish, profiteering repair cost (given that this is due to substandard manufacture, I'd tolerate it more if I had eg dropped it or broken the screen etc!). I would think I should still be entitled to at least the part given that the original two provided were defective? I've tried raising this with HP privately but having 'escalated' this, the case was closed without response (usually a decent indicator that you are right) today. Does anyone have any experiences of this (if they can get them in before this is no doubt removed for discussing a genuine issue!)?

HP Envy X-360. My hinge assembly has broken, it wasn't the fault of the user but a flaw in the design of the product and from what I understand is a known problem at HP. First question is why hasn't the product been recalled if it is a known issue? My warranty has expired but I feel that I should be able to send my laptop to HP for repair at no cost to me because it is a flaw in the design. I am very upset at the quality of this product because until recently have we used it because of my son's schooling and it breaks. If I could only talk to a human being I could express all of this. To be honest my daughter has used a Mac for 3 years with no problems at all, I think you know where I am going with that... I need this fixed!

Hello Everyone,I am trying to reach out to the hp support team but I am unable to. My hp envy x360’s screen was popping out from the bottom left hinge of the laptop. My laptop is out of warranty and since I am an international student, I was hesitant to get it fix because of the expenses.Today when I was shutting down the laptop and closing it, the screen broke from the bottom left corner from where it was popping out before. I do not know what to do. How much the replacement would cost? How much would it cost if I renew my warranty and how much it cost to renew the warranty? This is my final exam week of school and I do not know how long it would take to get the screen replaced. i would appreciate if anyone can help me.

Broken left hinge again and screen wires 15-bs087clWas typing on laptop with slightly ""bulging screen and keyboard"" from last fix, when the screen went black. Could hear laptop still running and noticed wires that are likely hidden in the hinge space sticking out from the back of keyboard faceplate and traveling up to screen, but one wire appears worn and possibly broken inside. I'm assuming providing power to screen. Really a poor design in this hinge and have managed to keep it working with major glue/epoxy because HP did nothing for initial problem, I had to fix it myself. Need to know if I can locate the same case and just transfer all of the ""guts"" of this machine to a new chassis of the same model.

Purchased this HP laptop at Sam's Club Nov. 2017, Model # 15-bs087cl. I believe they still sell it. The unit is fantastic and I have enjoyed it's size, speed and overall structure, except for one issue....the left hinge. For several months it seemed loose and I just assumed it shifted but was not a problem. One day I went to close the laptop and noticed the display edges separating from  the back  and beginning to bend in a way that would permanently damage it. I began noticing the forum issues and went back to my paperwork to see the warranty info. It had a 1-year mfr warranty and the 2-Year Care Pack was included to extend the warranty. Because it is now April 2020, I need to get this repaired or the unit will further deteriorate. I purchased with a credit card that also offers extension of warranty, but I feel this is an HP issue, and not one of abuse or any mistreatment; I'm on my 10th laptop over the years and this one gets little movement away from a carpeted storage spot. What should I do?

I loved my HP Envy 360 so much, I bought one for each of my daughters. Then one day, my touch screen starting acting bizarre. I disabled the touch ability, and everything settled down, and then I noticed a small crack in the bottom of the screen, and then one day the hinge near the crack popped open making it very difficult to open and close. Now that I've read all of the complaints concerning these hinges, I am beyond sorry I purchased two more. Especially for my art daughter who uses it more often all the way open. My question, should I have the screen and hinge replaced? Is it worth it, or should I just move on to a different laptop? (And different brand!) I gave up on HP printers years ago, but I really have enjoyed my Envy up to this point.

I am incredibly disappointed with HP; I purchased my computer just long enough for the warranty to expire before one of the hinges attching the screen to the keyboard snapped, something that has since made the computer difficult to close and, in general, to use. This is a problem that other users have had on other ENVY models, yet when I attempted to reach out to an HP representative via telephone, I was informed that I would be charged $229.99 for a repair. It is both disheartening and mind-boggling that a mechanical issue, very likely one that stems from me being sent a defective product since this was not the result of the computer ever being dropped, would cost me about 20% of the price of the computer to repair.

Hi, I've noticed for a while that the hinges on my notebook have been becoming progressively weaker and the screen has started to be a lot looser when sat at my desk, moving when typing. I could hear a rattle inside the casing, and on removing the back cover, found that the plastic housing for the gold nuts which hold the hinge screws have completely disintegrated. The plastic is tiny and very flimsy. I paid a pretty good amount for this laptop, so am quite annoyed. I treat my laptop with a lot of care and it sits on a desk, so this really should not happen.Has anyone else found this problem with HP laptops?What can/will HP do to help on this? This really shouldn't be something that I have to pay for to get repaired - the build quality looks to be abysmal despite the otherwsie high spec at time of purchase.Thanks.

Costco is willing to look at it,but there is a 2-5 days delivery to them 1-3 day repair and 2-5 days for return. I appreciate them, but that is a week( best case scenario) without my computer. My question is: Why does Costco seem more concerned with their brand name than HP? Why is there no ""recall?"" What is Hp's plan for not letting consumers feel like they wasted $700? How does HP plan to regain the trust of it's customers? Thank you for listening and I welcome your timely response and solution.""

The right hinge started coming loose and now the left side is going. How can I fix this before the screen becomes completely detached? Everything is becoming unaligned, like the power plugin is very loose and barely connects. Hinges are forcing the case apart and don't dare to close.

So my computer has the broken HP hinge issue that is common to HP laptops documented in this forum and all over the internet, just Google this and the Southern District of Florida. I have talked to HP people on their Facebook page, their support phone number, and this forum and have been quoted anywhere between free and $400 to fix a known design defect in HP's hinge. When I finally got an HP rep to respond here, the first rep offered to fix the hinge for free, we got the information setup to have a box shipped out and all of a sudden a new rep starts talking to me and the first rep goes completely silent. The second rep proceeds to tell me I will have to pay to get the hinge fixed. When I told the second rep the first rep had already agreed to fix it for free and I had the conversation documented, they agreed to fix it for free. Then, the second rep told me they may not be able to fix it due to the common corporate scapegoat ""supply chain issues"" and offered me a $125 voucher to buy another HP computer. We again, got everything setup for me to send the computer in for HP to attempt to fix the hinge but just like the first rep, the second goes completely silent. So let's see if this gets any attention from HP. For anyone else who comes across this trying to get their hinge fixed, good luck, you will need it.

Purchased an HP Envy x360 15in laptop at the end of 2020 and just over a year later the hinge on the left side of the screen made a loud popping sound and broke. The screen is starting to detach from the back of the display as well. I contacted HP on Facebook and they said my computer was out of warranty but they told me I could contact the support number and they would be able to help. I called the support number they provided and after a round of call center hot potato with about 5 different people I was told that my computer is out of warranty and I could purchase an extended warranty. I told the phone rep I doubted me buying an extended warranty now would help since I had already reported the broken hinge. The rep finally acknowledged I was right. They then said I could send it off for repair and asked me for my email address and street address. After I gave them that information, they said they couldn't tell me how much it was going to cost and transferred me to another person. I had to tell them all the same information again and they finally told me it would cost over $400 to fix the hinge on a ""premium"" computer I paid $400 for. This is a know issue with all of HP's x360 line, a quick Google search truns up numerous YouTube videos about this, including a video from HP showing how to replace broken hinges, and a massive list of complaints on this forum about the hinge issue. Even if I would pay to have HP fix the hinges, they will just break in another year. HP's support has been completely unhelpful and un professional, one of the phone reps continuously told me it was all my fault the hinge broke and this isn't a problem with HP computers. Even after I told the rep I didn't drop the computer and there is no other scuffs or dents they continued to insist I intentionally broke the computer. I know I will never by another convertable computer from HP ever again and I'm very unlikely to ever purchase anything from HP ever again over this. HP knows this is an issue and they don't care to address it. HP makes big claims about caring about the environment, if they actually cared about the environment, they would do a better job of designign and building their products so we don't have to constantly buy replacements or ship them off to be repaird, all using fossile fuels and all contributing to increased waste and hurting the environment.

I bought my daughter an HP-15-bs131nr laptop for use at college in Dec 2017.  In February 2019 the left hinge of her laptop broke (no damage had been done to the laptop previously -- no drops/rough usage, etc).  She worked around the problem by being very careful when opening the latop since she needed if for school.  In April 2019, she received the 90B error on bootup that indicated the CPU fan is not working and the laptop would shutdown.  I think this issue is related to the hinge problem -- it appears that some of the debris from the broken hinge may have gotten into the CPU fan and jammed it.  I know that the laptop is no longer under warranty, but I know that HP has suffered a large number of hinge failures on their laptops and I hope that HP will provide some answers or assistance with getting her laptop returned to an operating condition.   I tried to contact customer support - but quite frankly the website is rather clunky and I have been unable to get a phone number to contact support.  I received an email from HP saying that I was assigned a case number when I put in my contact information, but I have never received any contact from HP.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I own a HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx and i have been using it for over a year and a half now. However for the last month, i have noticed difficulty opening and closing the laptop and after searching carefully, i found out that the hinge is broken and some portion of the hinge looks exposed and some portions of the screen case looks a bit exposed also. I have never dropped the laptop and never caused any physical damage to the laptop due to negligence. My question is, will warranty cover the repair of the broken hinge and exposed screen case and if not, how much would it cost (out of pocket)  to repair it?  Thanks

I bought an HP ENVY laptop 16 months ago. But since I bought it, I was having issues with the audio system. I sent it for repair twice but still, they couldn't fix it. After the second attempt, I got tired and stopped sending for the so-called ""repair"". I was adjusting to that issue until this week. But this week, it got broken without doing anything. Since my warranty was expired in Sept (1 yr), I called HP support and requested them for repair. I said many times that I will pay the cost needed to repair it but they said they are unable to fix this specific model. I then visited a local repair center, they said the hinge and screen are broken, which will cost ~$400 to fix. I am now throwing it in the trash and thinking to buy a new brand. I will never ever recommend HP products to my friends, family, or anyone in my life who asks me for suggestions. Choosing HP is one of my worst decision ever.PLEASE DON'T BUY IT. If you don't understand now, you will realize later whenever you have the same issue.

The plastic around the hinge has popped open and does not pop back into place, I have tried to tape the casing closed but didn't hold for long. Some pieces of plastics have broken off internally from attempting to open and close, I now just leave it open. The frame is also coming away from the screen. Would I be able to replace the body of the laptop or will I need to send it off to be replaced? This laptop has been used daily for the last four years so I believe this is the reason for the body coming apart

I've repeatedly performed the battery test and the recommended procedure (remove battery, press power for 15 seconds, re-install, restart). This only fixes the problem temporarily.  The battery will charge, the laptop will operate properly. After several uses, where the charging appears to be OK, charging stops. I changed to my spare battery. Same result. Is there a solution ?

It seems there are numerous posts on the HP forum and on other forums discussing problems with broken hinges.   My left hinge of my Envy x360 has broken and come out, however I have never dropped or damaged the laptop, neither have I flipped the screen to use in tablet mode. The laptop is only 13 months old and only a month out of its warranty. Anybody know what to do?

I have been using my laptop for 2 years. I really need it for school and about a month ago the bottom right corner of the screen popped out. At first it was fine I just had to pop it back in but now it makes a terrible cracking noise when I try to close it so I've just been keeping it open. I dont want to have to bring it back to school where I constantly close and open it to transport it to and from classes. I know the hinge is broken but I dont know how to go about fixing it without breaking it more. Help.

My laptop is a little over a year old and the hinge completely destroyed on me when I attempted to open the top portion like any other day. Screws flew everywhere and black hinge cover completely fell off. I looked to see if the damage was repairable and screen became completely detached from the bottom portion. It is connected by few wires. I called and I was told it is not covered under warranty and would cost the amount I purchased the thing brand new. This is clearly a designer flaw and no damage was done to laptop on my end.  I am really disappointed in HP as a company and don't foresee future purchases. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this issue? I desperately need my laptop for school and work. Any help is much appreciated. The situationis similar to https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...But much worse

My HP Envy is out of warranty, and I am a student who pays for their own university, so not only is my laptop essential, but I also can't afford a new one or an expensive repair. I don't know what happened to my envy because I have never dropped it and always transport it in a  padded laptop case, but the hinges on both sides seem to be coming undone. The right corner of the screen is coming apart, and evrytime I open or close my laptop it makes cracking noises. When I look straight down at where the screen meets the lower chassis, they dont connect in a straight line anymore. I really don't know how to fix this, and everytime I open my laptop, I'm scared it's going to fall apart. I have researched this issue because it seems super weird that a pretty new laptop would start to fall apart like this, and lo and behold--the envy is NOTORIOUS for hinges breaking and general issues with the case coming apart, so I suppose that would make it a manufacturing issue. I just don't know what to do.

I purchased the laptop in April 2021. I bought this model because of the ability to use as a tablet. I open the laptop two days ago and hear a clicking sound, then find little plastic bits on the left side of the laptop. The hinge broke and now I am afraid to close the laptop because the screen is lifted up on the left lower corner. I expected a laptop in this price range to have better designed hinges. Looks like HP cut corners on quality an used plastic to secure what needs to be a very sturdy part of a convertible laptop. I have recommended Hp computers to my friends and family. Now I don't think you produce the quality I associated with HP products. How do I get this fixed? Did I waste $1,000? The hinge should last longer than 18 months.

The hinge has given out on my HP Envy x360, with no drops/damages and purely naturally started happening on its own. I can't even fold the laptop because the hinge prevents the lid from doing so.

Hello, I bought a Hp ENvy 15 TS Notebook back in 2014 and about a year and a half ago the hinge broke but recently I have become really annoyed because I need to move my laptop around more and cant fold the screen down because of the hinge. I have never dropped my laptop, I rarely move it from my desk. Is there anywhere near Dublin Ireland I can get it fixed?

My laptop has developed a hinge problem in the last week. When the screen is opened the right rear area of the base cover is lifted up, and when the screen is lowered  there is a loud pop and the cover opens up exposing the motherboard inside. If I press down on the black cover it presses back into place with a snapping sound. The screen hinge on the right has up and down play which the left side does not have. If I press the screen down when opening or closing it doesn't pull the corner open as much. There is the noise of a piece of plastic rattling around inside the laptop. I have not tried removing the screws on the bottom silver cover of the laptop. I have seen many complaints about broken hinges on HP laptops. I have had this laptop for about 18 months and have not abused it at all. I am very familiar with building and repairing computer towers, but have little experience with laptops and so have not done any experimentation with the hardware. The nearest HP repair depot is about an hours drive from my home .  I was wondering what options I have before this problem grows. Russell Anderson

Hi, My laptop is a HP Pavilion 15-bs000 Notebook PC and my 14 year old is using that for home schooling (due to COVID-19). I am having the same Display Panel Hinges problem as many other users on this forum encountered and the laptop is becoming more and more vulnerable and useless. The display itself is fine. There is a cracking sound when opening and closing the lid and I really feel unsecure about my kid using this for her schooling. When I searched the web/HP Support forums, I now see it seems to be a common manufacturing issue. My HP Pavilion is about two years old and therefore out of warranty. We are always careful with this laptop, never dropped it and it never leaves the house. I am very happy with the laptop and would use this for my kids schooling work and continue using it. I am currently in Charlotte, NC (USA). I would GREATLY appreciate any help to expedite and getting it fixed/resolved by HP support/service team asap?  Thank you in advance!

I bought my HP Envy x360 Convertible laptop in November of last year through Best Buy.   Today, less than a year after purchasing the laptop, the right side hinge has come apart.  I've used my laptop gently; the device has no other malfunctions or damage.  Today, when I closed the screen, I heard a loud crunch, and the hinge began pushing the screen away from its housing.  After doing some research, it looks like this is a very common issue with the HP Envy laptop.   I'm unsure if the laptop automatically comes with a warranty, and I'm unable to locate the purchase email from Best Buy.  Does HP have a base warranty for its laptops?

The convertible 13-bd0504sa model's hinge became detached from the touchscreen. This is a convertible laptop so clearly I bought it with portability in mind. I have read other instances on HP forum of the left hinge becoming broken. Subsequently when trying to attach the hinge back into the casing of the touchscreen, the right hinge was damaged and the screen cracked. Wire connecting the base of the laptop to the touchscreen also got damaged and screen no longer displays anything. The damage is extensive (now beyond repair) and the seller was Currys PC World (UK Branch) who refused to repair/refund due to accidental damage even though it has been less than 30 days since purchase. It technically is accidental damage but from trying to repair a broken hinge arising from a potential design flaw. Can I perhaps bring up the sale of goods act? Is there any use in contacting HP to get an exchange when I cannot prove the left hinge broke first? It was definitely the left hinge and no excessive forces were applied combined with evidence online of this happening to others seems to indicate a design flaw. Is there any way forward or possibility to claim compensation does anyone know?

I have had my HP Envy x360 just over a year, so it is now out of warranty. I haven't had any problems with it until a couple days ago, when I tried to open it and one of the hinges broke. It is now stuck open, as any closing or further opening/adjustments cause the broken hinge to push on the screen, which I am really worried will break. This seems to be a really common problem- I'm just really worried about what to do, as I am scared to continue using the product at all. It is the left hinge which is broken.  Any help at all would be amazing- Thank you so much!

Hello all... As of now, my HP hinge is broken and I am scared to even close the lid as I can see the electronic circuitry popping out. The laptop was bought 2 years ago and hence no longer under warranty but it's a terrible shame that this will happen. I am a careful user and the hinge did not last long enough after the warranty. I am not willing to pay a hefty amount for fixing the issue since I believe it's a design fault. How should I address this issue. Please guide. Thank you,Sachin

I'm extremely shocked and disappointed today as I had the same experience with my new hp X360 envy laptop, The right side hinge has begun to open up and does not allow me to close or open the laptop any further. It makes a very painful cracking noise when I attempt to close the lid. Surprisingly this happened exactly 1 month after the warranty period has expired. Seeing all the messages in this thread I think this is very common with this laptop. I do not know what has to be done at this stage as I bought this laptop only a year ago and I have always handled it in the best possible manner. Being a university student I used it very minimally for study and research purposes and this is the condition of this laptop. It is very depressing and disappointing seeing the quality of HP laptops come to this state. Please help me as I need my laptop for my university.

Hello,I have an HP Envyx360 that is a little over 2 years old. When coming into work yesterday I attempted to open my computer and heard a loud crack. After looking over the computer myself and some other co-workers that heard the crack realized that the hinge had popped out and the screen is now separating from the rest of the computer. After looking up this issue I now see that this has been a major design flaw with HP and seems to be an issue they are not willing to stand behind the issue. I reached out to HP regarding this and spoke to a Rene Rose with the warranty sales team and after pleading my case he said they will look at it but its a minimum $416 dollars. This puts an extremely sour taste in my mouth that they are not only willing to stand behind their product but also throw a extreme price out without even having it in the hand. Rene was not helpful at all and I got the impression he was just trying to move on to his next phone call.  I have 4 seperate articles saved regarding this issue on the HP Envy computers. This does not sit well with me and I will not support HP if they don't support their customers. The hardest thing to grasp is everything else on the computer works great and nothing was done to damage the computer in anyway and that the hinge just popped. My question is how do I get through to somebody at HP that can actually help resolve this issue? Am I better off buying a new computer and just leaving terrible reviews on Consumer affairs, PC Magazine, Best Buy, H.P community, and Amazon? Looking for any help and support I can get! Thank you!

The right-side hinge just cracked today through normal use. The laptop isn't that old either. Maybe 2 years tops. Now I can't change the position of the screen without the monitor being pried apart. Can you put me in touch with support ASAP please. Very disappointed to have this happen on a nearly $1000 laptop. That's disappointing in itself. Please do something to rectify the situation as fast as possible. This laptop that I use for work can't be transported anywhere in the condition it's in. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a laptop in the first place.

Hi, My name is Sagar. I bought a hp pavilion 15-cs2082tx laptop for my study.I was very excited as I had trust in hp just after fews months. I started hearing some sort of sound while opening and closing the laptop. I went to the HP authorised service center. They opened the covered, dismantled my laptop, bent all the hinges and told me the right hinges and back socket are broken. And I cannot close the screen.He also told me it might be a manufacturing issue. And the charges for fixing the issue is 16K. And home visiting changes extra 1200 rupees.Unless I make the payment he cannot do anything as the laptop is more than year old and out of warranty.I never miscued laptop or thrown it accidentally. I saw in quora and google many people are also getting the same issue which is fixed by HP free of cost. I hope some one response to this message and make my laptop repair for free of cost as it was a manufacturing defect. Thank you

I have an HP ENVY x360 Laptop - 13-ay0045au which was purchased on 07-01-2021 and is currently out of its 1st year of warranty. Last night while closing the laptop I heard some creaking noises and saw that the right hinge was out of place and putting pressure on the screen. The screen is OK but now I am scared to open the laptop as it's bending the right side out while trying to open it, I don't want to crack the screen.After looking for answers regarding the issue found that this is a ""COMMON ISSUE"" in this lineup of laptops?! This is my third HP laptop I have the utmost respect for the brand that's why I got this laptop but seeing that for so many years people have been having this issue about the hinges and still, they haven't changed it shatters my expectations.I wanted to get a clear answer before heading to a nearby service center about whether they will or will not charge me to get this fixed. I currently can't open/close my laptop due to the fear of breaking the screen which will not be by any means will be fixed by HP as mentioned in so many forum posts and online. Hopefully, someone gets in touch soon or just be left hanging until the issue becomes worse.

I purchased the HP envy x360 laptop (model as in title description) online and the UK PC world Currys chain was the seller. However within the 30 day period the left hinge broke. There was no sudden application of pressure or any crazy torques so it was surprising when I revolved the screen to see the left corner of the screen was protruding outwards from seemingly no impact. Then I tried to rotate it back and the hinge came out of the screen. I thought it wouldnt be difficult to snap it back into place but after attempting to do that the second right hinge came out. And repeated attempts to fix this resulted in a cracked screen and the Currys seller refused to compensate claiming damage was induced by me and couldnt apply prompt repair within the 30 day period of purchase as accidental damage is not covered. While this is true the initial problem was with the hinge itself, and there are repeated posts about a flaw in the design of the left hinge specifically which seems to have been the root cause of this. Understandably I am not too pleased with the situation , I am seeking advice on what steps to take it any are available to resolve this issue? Right now I dont see a way forward and just accepting that this sets me back ~600 pounds. I would only be okay if I applied excessive force or sudden jerking motion but my laptop was not subjected to anything that should cause a hinge to come out.

Less than 2 years, the left hinge has broken and caused the screen to crack. I have kept this laptop on my desk for the last few weeks and have never used it in tablet mode during this time.

My hp envyx360 hinge was broken so I got it repaired after the repair I was unable to use m webcam.When I open the camera or any app just a blank screen is appearing.

My laptop detects the webcam whenever I open meet or skype showing hp wide vision camera found but a blank screen.  And I reset only the C drive.Help me, guys.

The left hinge was replaced by HP some time ago. The new hinge hasn't held up. The hinge is misaligned and that caused stress on the right hinge. Now the case has started to separate on the right side and the case has developed a crack. I tried one of the private service centers that is listed on the HP site. The service center says they don't repair/replace cases.Any suggestions on how I may get my case fixed?

The plastic pieces holding my screen in place broke and I am wondering approximately how much it would cost to replace the backing. Because the pieces broke, the screen is very wobbly which makes it difficult to use. Would it be more simple to buy a new computer, or is there a way to get this fixed?

I bought my HP Envy TS 15 a while ago and I am well out of my warranty. One day I heard a sudden click and found that the left hinge broke and saw small black pieces of plastic falling from it. The bottom left corner came apart and I can't fold my laptop down anymore. This is extremely inconvenient and clearly a manufacturing error. HP should be held responsible for this even after the warranty expires, they should have recalled this model since the issue is very common. This will definitely make me think twice before considering the purchase of another HP in the future.I need a solution for this. If someone can please direct me to where I can get it fixed in Saudi, I would really appreciate it.

Where can I fix this and how much will it cost? I am very much concerned and worried because I have two more of the same make and model I bought for my two daughters at same time and these may soon develop similar problem. My family had owned several HP laptop models in the past with good service records from the laptops. What has gone wrong now? Has HP jumped into a technology they are not yet ready for? I live at Ft Lauderdale Florida, USA. Where can I fix this and can this problem be successfully repaired and quickly so, not giving me one month or two appointment to repair it? I just learnt through this community postings that HP has inherent problem with HINGE and SCREEN panel engineering particularly with the 2 in 1 HP laptop products. I wish they will acknowledge this issue and fine ways to resolve it and so reduce their loyal customers' frustrations. Please I need help.

Hello HP Community, Would advise you to notify your friends and family NOT to go for the new Elitebook series . Nightmare began in march 1st week, within two months of purchase of the laptop worth 1.5 Lacs INR . The display screen got unhinged on its own without any pressure , damaging the screen . With red and blue lines on the screen the laptop was left unusable. Thousands of calls requests to HP authorised center ( dont even try the whatsapp or other conversations - these calls will not resolve any issue but exist only to give the impression that the complaint and the user are being taken care of) led to a technician being assigned by TVS E -authorised service center in Mumbai on 7th March 2019. Post that it has been living hell trying to get HP to replace the part which is out of warranty. TVS E has no idea when the part will be delivered and HP call center has zero accountability in trying to close the loop. [edit]

Hi HP Community, Purchased the HP Elitebook X360 in  Jan 2019 as official and personal usage. Though it has a touchscreen tablet mode, i have scarcely used this mode. Mostly used the standard laptop format. Despite minimal usage and wear tear, the right hand hinge started shaking and the display screen got unseated from its base, rendering the screen with purple lines and a black shade covering 30% of the screen area. This model with the config that i have taken costs upwards of 150 K INR.Any one who has recently purchased faced this poor workmanship on a highly rated HP Laptop  ?Its been just 60 days of limited usage and already the hinges are wobbly and the screen has come out of its case. HP service center is yet to depute an engineer for the same. Disappointed with you, HP !

So, I purchased this laptop in January of 2018 to replace another HP laptop that a family member had accidentally broken. The laptop worked just fine, but just this week, I had closed my laptop to hear a loud snap. I checked my laptop and saw that one of the hinges came loose as well as some of the cover of the laptop on top. I wasn’t sure how this could’ve happened. I’ve never dropped my computer, and I don’t take it anywhere. The most I’ve done to this computer is opening and closing it. And unfortunately, my warranty had expired just a month ago. I was willing to repair my laptop, and I took it to a repair store who told me I need to replace the entire LCD back cover of my laptop. The part I needed wasn’t available, however. Not on the HP parts store, not on Ebay, and not on Amazon. The part number is 926489-001. I’m not entirely sure what to do, as I would rather not buy a new laptop, which would be pricey, and all my information is stored on this laptop, but I need a new computer immediately for college. I’ve been using HP for the past 7 years, and I considered it the only brand I trust, and I’m deeply disappointed at this, my laptop broke all on its own. Is there a way I could contact HP and possibly resolve this issue? I’m not entirely sure what to do. Thank you!

So I bought my hp envy x360 barely a year ago, and have hardly used it since buying it for graphic design and not really having time to do that.. here I am a month over my warranty expiring, I picked up the laptop to move it from my desk to my room and noticed the screen separating because of a broken hinge.. from what I’m seeing HP knows this is an issue, and does not like to fix it even with a current warranty for some.. not really sure what to do, but I guess HP will not be a brand we continue using if I cannot get into contact with someone to help me at barely a year of owning a $1000 pc that’s already broken from less than normal wear and tear…

Hello HP, I've had my envy for around 4 years and the problem of the left hinge started a long time ago. In fact, when I first showed this computer to my colleague he mentioned that at some point the left hinge was going to break at some point in the near future. I then noticed a pop sound every time I would open/close the laptop but I ignored it until the casing started to pop. I then realized that it was starting to look similar to what my colleague reported when he started this thread:  https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/17-quot-HP-Envy-Coming-apart-a... Our institution had recommended these laptops but so far two of us who are using them have had the same problem and we really love the performance but the left hinges seem to be problematic as per the posts below:  https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/17-quot-HP-Envy-Coming-apart-a... https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-17-quot-Left-HInge-Bro...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-15-6-quot-Left-Hinge-B...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/17-quot-HP-Envy-Coming-apart-a... Also note that I rarely use this computer - You can see from the casing that it has no scratches or dents from regular use or any sort of abuse. I only started using it regularly recently after switching from my other computer and this is when the hinge problem was aggravated.  Please advise on how to resolve this - everyone I have spoken to informs that this is a design issue from HP and I should be entitled to support.  Thanks and regards, Sara

I have an HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15-bp1xx (3TS71UA#ABA) laptop. I noticed that the right-side hinge is loose/broken and the front and back are separating from each other on that side. The system still operates and there doesn't appear to be any damage to the display itself. Is there a fix for this? Out of warranty.Thank you

Hi, I have been facing major problems with the broken hinge. Without even dropping the laptop, one day I open it, I hear a crack and the right hinge to the display is broken. Apart from that, now the webcam is not functioning and although it was booting up then, after a week it was not booting up. My laptop is under warranty and I live in Munich, Germany and apparently there is no service centre here at all. I tried calling with no one answering. When I was visiting my parents in India, I tried contacting the one service centre in Chennai, but the phone number did not exist. I took the laptop to them and they said the part (connector) was not available. I really don't know what to do at this point. Any help in the matter is greatly appreciated!Thank you.

Hello, I purchased an HP Spectre 360 a little over a year ago. Within 2 days I experienced what appeared to be a stress crack near the hinge. Luckily I purchased a Geek Squad protection warranty and was able to get the screen repaired. However, I noticed that there would be times that my notebook would experience flickers that would impact my mouse sensitivity and at times cause screen flickers. Usually closing my notebook and reopening it would temporally resolve the problem. However, I recently experienced another spontaneous screen crack that AGAIN appeared to originate at the hinge. The notebook was sitting on my desk charging overnight. When I opened the notebook to check my email I noticed the crack. AGAIN, I took my notebook BACK to Best Buy to have it repaired for a second time. I LITERALLY just received the notebook back YESTERDAY afternoon, TODAY I am experiencing the screen flickers and mouse interruption ALL over again. (Keep in mind I have a BRAND NEW screen) AGAIN it appears that the stress may be related to the hinge. I decided to research the issue because what are the odds that the same symptoms and ultimately need for repair would present multiple times? While researching it appears that this is a common issue with the HP Spectre 360. What is HP doing to address these issues to prevent them from recurring? I suspect that this may be a design flaw if so how is HP addressing this issue?  Has anyone else experienced this issue?  If so, how was it resolved once and for all?

I have an HP Pavilion x360. The computer screen has popped out in the right hand corner and the right hinge is broken as well. The computer is amazing and I do want the problem fixed. Has this happened to anyone else? I’m not looking to pay an arm and a leg to repair the computer. Lol. I have shopped around and to repair the computer it’s more than the computer is worth. Crazy I know? Does HP assist costumers with this issue? I think they should, it’s there product which should have been tested thoroughly.

I bought an HP Envy m6 new, and have probably had it for less than two years. For some reason one of the hinges snapped, and the back of the casing in that corner popped out. I put tape around the corner for support, which worked for a few months, but now the other hinge has also snapped. This has caused the casing to start separating from that side as well. I now have a laptop with two broken hinges, casing that is falling apart, and a crack on one of the front bottom corners.

I am disappointed at how fragile this laptop seems to be, as I was looking forward to many more years with it, and I don't think it will last much longer in its current condition. This puts me in a difficult situation as I use this laptop regularly, and rely on it being in good working order. I no longer feel I can open and close this laptop without causing significant damage, and am at a loss for where to go from here. Is there anything that can be done?Thank you.

There is a plastic bar that covers the hinges and connects to the screen on my HP laptop. It's connectors are broken and it keeps falling off. The part number is #A-2FF. I tried to order new parts but my laptop's serial # isn't recognized by HP nor can I find a customer support email to order the part.  Here are photos of the part and the laptop respectively:

I purchased a loaded up HP Envy 15t to ensure longevity in 2013. As noted by many other users, the hinge on the left side where the display connects to the laptop has broken. There was no ""incident"", ie. drop, physical event, that caused this. It simply became disconnected after routine use. Of course, it is out of warranty. The laptop still works fine and would have a lot of use left in it if the display wasn't hanging on the left side due to the broken hinge. Given the number of similar reports it seems this is a design defect in these models. Is this fixable?

I've had my laptop for about a year and a half now. I first started to see problems as the front of the screen started peeling away from the plsatic, then the bottom of the screen started popping open. Now all of a sudden one day I tried to close it and the hinge just flat of broke. Sounded like I was crunching gravel as things started to pop out. This is a common issue that I've seen in many other posts that is clearly a design flaw. I'm quite disappointed given HP usually has great quality, yet here my expensive laptop breaks within two years of gentle use.  I've taken great care of it and never have dropped it. But now I can't even close the laptop out of fear It will totally break apart. How come HP hasn't done anything to solve this issue!?!?! Similar feeds:https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hinge-broken/m-p/7522794https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Gaming-Notebooks/HP-Gaming-Pavilion-hinge-breaking-after-1-5-years/m-p...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Pavillion-Gaming-PC-Hinge-broke-af...

I have a HP ENVY x 360 bought some time ago. I had issues with the broken left hinge which I posted on the forum. The only responses I got was to pay almost 400$ to get it fixed since it was out of warranty (multiple emails from HP reps).The problem isn't just mine and it is a manufacturer's defect, which I believe should be recalled and fixed by HP. Has anyone gotten them fixed recently? The issue on my laptop has now escalated and I have to tape the screen to the metallic casing. Few of the cheap plastic components around the hinge have fallen off and I'm worried that one day this is going to break my screen too.I loved the features this HP laptop brought so paid good price however, with all these issues, it seems I shouldn't have gone for HP. I'm never going for HP again.  Do not buy HP ENVYx360, if you are planning to.

Hello, my 17z-ca100 is having issues opening and closing. Unfortunately it is outside of the 1 year warranty. It has never been dropped, but it appears the plastic around the right hinge has broken.

Hi - I wonder if anyone can advise me if the problem I am experiencing is fixable by me, at home?  For a while I've heard creaking noises from the right hand hinge on my laptop.  Recently it appears to have become so stiff it has snapped off two screw retaining plastic mouldings from the top of the hinge, i.e. the bit attached to the screen.  These sheared mouldings have fallen out of the gap which has opened up with screws still intact. I really have to leave it open permanently now as attempting to open or close the lid is wrenching the screen surround away, bit by bit.  Does anyone know if this is a user fixable issue? I have seen some online videos but they seem to refer to different hinge types.

This seems like a pretty common issue, I see at least 3 other posts with the same problem. After about a year and a half of infrequent and careful use, the plastic in the hinge seems to have cracked and, as well as making the laptop impossible to close, is pulling the screen bezel off with it. Is there somewhere I can get a replacement part for this and repair myself? I saw on another post that it costs over $300 for to repair this and I think that's insulting for what is clearly a design flaw or manufacturing defect on an already expensive gaming laptop.

I bought my HP Envy about two years ago. I have always been quite careful with my computer, but the other day I went to open it and I heard a cracking sound. It took me a moment to realize that the hinge had just broken, separating the two halves of the case along the back and breaking some of the vent plastic off completely. Who do I need to speak to about this issue, as I have looked it up and found that this is a common problem with the product and that there are people who can help within HP.

My computer was purchased about two years ago. Only recently my computer made this cracking noise when I closed it. I looked around and couldn't find the issue until today when the trim around my screen was pulled off by half of my left plastic hinge, the bottom half. The hinge is in great condition and will even clip back on, but the issue is internally. Stripping back the trim and taking off the battery revealed the metal inside with connected by the hinge to my lid had come off; a black plastic gear that the metal thing had connected to had cracked and broken off. I don't know how to fix this. I am unable to open or close the lid for because of the broken connection on the left side, my plastic bottom hinge will not move, thus tearing my trim off the lid when I try to open or close.(This was posted word for word before on here but I have the exact same problem)

Hi. I recently bough an HP Envy m6-n012dx laptop. Not long after using it the Control Zone Trackpad began to be incredibly glitchy. Everytime i would move the mouse, it would jump randomly across the screen. The left side of the track pad that is supposed to allow you to switch between your open apps sometimes stops working then starts to work again then would stop working for no reason. Same with the right side that shows the start button, search button, settings button etc. To make things worse; sometimes the mouse would begin to move slowly across the screen without me even touching the track pad. I try downloading the most recent synaptics driver and afterwards the trackpad worked for a little while, then went haywire again. Not only is the trackpad messed up but sometimes my touch screen doesnt work. For instance, my touch screen currently isnt working as im typing this. What do i have to do to solve the problem, because i really like this laptop when everything is working fine

Hello everyone, I have an HP 17-bs0xx laptop that has two broken hinges and now a screen that has completely separated from the keyboard.  Unfortunately, when the screen came loose it also seemed to disconnect a wire to a WIFI related component located near the screen, and now the computer is completely useless.  My questions are: how best to have the outer case and hinges replaced and the wifi adapter or antenna repaired; what the cost on that may be; who can do that type of repair and thoughts on whether fixing it is even worth it?  I would like to get it fixed if it makes financial sense. The computer doesn't have too many miles on it as the hinge problem started within three months of buying it and we had been dealing with the issue by propping the screen up and using duct tape to keep everything together.  Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have a HP 15-ay000 Notebook PC.  It is several years old and no longer under warranty.  After using my computer with no issues for 2 years or, the plastic laptop cover started cracking/breaking near the lower right hinge.  Over time, various bits of plastic and small screws would break and fall out of this area though it would still close with no problem.  Recently however, the lower right hinge appears to have broken completely.  The laptop does not close at all without really forcing it to close, and it appears that further damage might be caused by closing the laptop.   Does anyone have information about replacement parts (hinge, cover) for this laptop from HP or from a 3rd party vendor?

I purchased a HP Pavillion G7-2246NR Laptop with a 17.3 inch screen from Office Depot on Nov. 26, 2012.
 
The computer worked great until about a month ago when the left hinge seemed to be coming loose.  All I use this computer for is to surf the net at night while we watch TV so it rarely gets used.
 
Now the hinge has completely came out of the case and it has apparently  caused damage to the power button.  The computer will not power up at all.
 
I certainly believe this computer that I rarely use should have lasted more than a year and a half.  Is there a recall or some sort of free repair for these clearly defective units?
 
Please contact me for a solution,

I suddenly noticed a crack on the upper left hand corner of the notebook's case, and despite being as gentle as I could with the notebook. The crack completely formed and now I am afraid to handle it in any way. The top hinge and a small portion of the case has completely broken off from the rest of the case, right where the power button is. Being a computer science major in university, desperately needing a notebook that does not break after only a couple years would be an understatement. The notebook is no longer under warranty, however the break seemed like a design malfunction that I definitely cannot afford to replace a notebook over.

Hi, I have a HP Pavilion 14-ce0xxx The left hinge panel has snapped in half, I think this can be replaced. BUT the plastic part into which the screws go has also snapped (even though it should be glued firmly to the display enclosure), meaning there is nothing to screw a new hinge panel into. Desperate to know how to fix this dodgy manufacturing from HP - seems ridiculous to get rid of a 500 quid laptop because of a rubbish bit of plastic.

 Recently, I closed my laptop and I heard a crack sound.  Upon closer observation, I realized that my laptop's central hinge is broken and tearing away from the base.  This is also causing the panels on the front and back of the screen on the right side of the laptop to tear away from the screen.  Based on the wide number of similar posts by other purchasers that I have read, I can only assume that the problem resides with the shoddy parts and hardware on this model, as opposed to just normal wear and tear.  This Laptop is still under HP warranty.

Hi all, I have multiple HP laptops but I guess I am learning that their hinges are really bad. This is my second HP x360 that landed with a broken hinge and just this time it also caused the screen to crack. I called up the repair (it is under warranty) and they asked me to send it in. After keeping the laptop for six days and telling me that the laptop has been repaired and under testing, I got a message today that this is customer induced damage. No further information is shared. I need help in dealing with the situation. I have photos of the laptop before I sent it. Clearly the screen broke at the hinge point and that too it came out. I don't think HP wants to tell me that I somehow pulled out the screen. Also other than this, I do not have a single scratch on the laptop. I know this forum is to solve other operating issues but I am hoping someone with similar experience may be able to help on how to get HP to honor their warrenty.

The very reason I bought a convertible is the same reason why I am afraid to use it as a convertible. Due to the plastic parts, it has broken off twice. Good thing is that it has broken during the warranty and extended warranty. Now I don't know how much, how come one of the priciest laptops you produce which suppose to be the best of the best gets broken twice. I wish I could get a replacement or store credit where I can replace it with another laptop. It breaking off this way, is not only financially draining but even emotionally as this wasn't a budget-friendly buy to be exact. I hope HP's support could help me in any way.

We bought our HP Envy x360 laptop in late 2018 from Costco in preparation to replace our older computer. I thought that the HP-Costco-Citi relayed 4-year warranty would well cover us. I was even happier when we started using it in Feb. 2019 and saw that HP online record showed the one-year manufacture's warranty was from Feb. 2019 to Feb.2020. Not long after the one-year manufacturer's warranty expired in Feb. 2020, the hinge issue came up. The laptop still has Year2 to Year4 warranty covered by Costco and Citi card benefits but we could not get a requested repair quote right away because of factors such as its being used every day, the stay-at-home orders, etc. When we finally were able to go to the HP certified repair center available within 50 miles, UBreakIfix, they could only provide a non-repair statement because the top case needed was unavailable indefinitely. In searching for repair options, I found that this was in fact a pretty common design flaw in many envy laptops as https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-X360-Hinge-broken/m-p/...Begin Quotes 1. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/HP-Envy-Left-Hinge-Broken/m-p/6979085...2. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-Hinge-Popped-Open/m-p/...3. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-ENVY-x360-15T-BP000-HINGE-I...4. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-Left-Hinge-HP-Envy-x...5. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Defective-left-hinge-HP-ENVY-x... End-QuotesBecause of this experience, we returned two HP laptops recently purchased from Costco.

Hello,I purchased my Envy x360 in November 2017 after my previous laptop's battery continually broke. Since purchase, I have kept my Envy in the best condition possible, never dropping it or allowing much damage to come to it. I noticed, this past week, that the left hinge is not only broken, but has also been damaging my laptop's screen, causing it to open up.I took to the Internet to these forums and found that this problem is VERY commonplace and is not due to user error, but due to a design flaw in a weak hinge. I find it 'convenient' that the hinge breaks a month after warranty, around the same time as countless other cases. Is there anybody that can assist me in fixing this issue? I purchased this laptop for approximately $1,000 expecting it to last a few years, not break once the warranty expires. Most likely will not be returning to HP moving forward.

The left hinge seized and broke through the screen when I opened it. I purchased this laptop 2 years ago. I read in several online forums that this has been an issue with these hinges. Does HP offer any warranty for this. I realize the standard warranty has expired. I'm quite disappointed. We have purchased multiple HP laptops and printers. I'm losing faith in HP with this issue.

.Hello, I have had  my laptop for nearly two years and ran into a problem, late 2017 or early 2018, I think. I noticed that screws were missing at the bottom one day which was strange to me because I barely moved it. I told my  mother at the time and that's when I closely watched. I noticed the left hinge began to break, so I kept it open 24/7 from that point out but still had to close it occassionally when it was on the go with me. Now at this point the corner near the power putting is coming up and there's a crack near the left ESC button and the hinge is still broken. My warranty has been up since Dec 2017 and I've been trying to find alternatives, but to no avail. I noticed that hinge problems are common among HP laptops after doing some research when mine started. The capability of the laptop is great, but the make of it is designed poorly. I would hate for my laptop to give out on me seeing as this is my first one and I'm a student and I use this for everything. I love the laptop, but it's unfair on how much money is put into these laptops and in return after a year or so the laptop wants to begin to fall apart. Please help. Thank you in advance!

Both hinges on my HP Envy m6 have broken. The computer is about 5 months out of warranty. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. The hinges should never break down in such a short time.   Reading through the many posts on this hinge problem I think HP should have a recall on all the defective hinges and make things right.

 #1Long story short, I bought HP Envy 17T (17M-AE111DX) laptop earlier this year that has HUGE problem with the hinge, and IMO a clear design defect.The hinge is really stiff, which is understandable given the size of the screen (17.3""). The problem is that the super stuff hinge and it's metal assembly is mounted simply onto the 2~3mm thick ABS plastic bottom case without any bracing or support. So as you open and close your LCD trhough daily use, you are putting tremendous stress on the screw mount points on that ABS plastic bottom case lid.It took about 8 month of use but it finally busted the screw mount point for the right side (as you use the laptop) hinge. There are only 7 screws holding the bottom cover together, and only 2 of them are used for securing the hinge to the bottom cover. This is the most incompetent design I've seen for a laptop hinge.  I called HP support and they asked me which side the hinge was broken. Then they told me they don't do any warranty repair on broken covers. If they don't do warranty repairs on broken covers, then why did they asked me which side broke first? They told me it will cost me $380 to fix it. I said the cover probably costs $50 from HP site. They basically said because the cover was physically broken, the warranty is void. Anyone else have this kind of issue with the 17"" Envy laptops?

i bought my hp pavilion gaming 15 cx0144tx laptop on  around july 2018 . It is still under a warranty period of more than one year.Just recently its left hinge lifted up which causes great inconvenience.ALSO this laptop gets very very hot under gaming and whats the point of buying a gaming laptop which rises to very high temperatures . VERY bad thermals . very bad customer care from hp . HP WANTS ME TO PAY FOR REPAIR. Whats the point of warranty then. Very bad laptop for gaming . GETS very hot . All these problems , then whats the point of buying a laptop worth Rs.100000.I invested so much money on this laptop for better performance only to get nothing. Very bad laptop for gaming as its name suggests [hp pavilion gaming].Being a experienced user i would advise everyone not to buy a gaming laptop from hp . Instead try other brands out there in terms of gaming. REALLY  DISAPPOINTING !!!!!! . ALSO games do not work smoothly on this laptop they lag a lot contrasting to that claimed by hp[that lag is a thing of past]. NOT FOR GAMING LAPTOP [OPPOSITE TO ITS NAME]

I have checked many articles on HP support community and identified that this is a known issue with HP Envy 360, My laptop is under extended warranty and I want this to be fixed by HP free of cost as this seems to a known issue and manufacturing/design issue.
 
I am also attaching few images of the damaged happened to my Envy 360.
I use this laptop for my office work, so request you to get this fixed ASAP as my official work is impacted.

I posted for help in the HP Community Support as an inside hinge has apparently broken in my laptop and it is causing the display to pop out. I was responded to by a ""rep"" who provided generic information as to how to go about getting it repaired at my cost to the tune of $250. WHY should we have to pay for a repair that we didn't cause?  I saw that he had more engagement with others that are having the same issue so I sent a direct message and he asked for my laptop info in order to have it looked into. And since then, I have heard nothing. This is not acceptable. This is clearly a design flaw as there are thousands of people reporting this issue. I cannot imagine that HP doesn't think this is something that they should take care of. I have included the contents of my original post below and I truly hope that you will help to resolve this issue.

Every time I opened/closed the lid or adjusted it, I heard it and it is wobbly. I looked at it today and the screen is popping out in the lower right hand corner. I can see everything behind it! And it seems the hinge(s) are loose and they are no longer even on both sides. This seems quite ridiculous and must be a design flaw as the laptop has not been dropped or had anything dropped on it. How does this just suddenly happen? On top of that, this model is the one that can be folded to convert to a tablet and I have only ever even done that twice since the purchase. Please help! I am a student and cannot afford to purchase another new laptop after only a couple of years due to again what can only be described as a design flaw.

I went to close my laptop today, the warranty having expired 31/10/21 and the hinge detached from the back for the screen. As I closed the screen, without realising the hinge wasn't moving, the hinge  pushed in to the screen and cracked the glass. The touchscreen is now not functioning and the laptop can't be closed. This is a ridiculous issue to be facing with a 1,5 year old machine at the price I paid for it. It seems to be a design flaw and I can see numerous other posts on the same issue,
 
I have tried to contact support, without success as they are essentially saying this is not their problem. I would like to escalate a complaint to the next level. How can I do this?

I have an HP Pavilion15 t-cx0000. The camera on it is displaying an error that there is no camera installed:My device manager also indicates that there are no camera drivers installed:  My laptop was working perfectly fine a month ago, and then I sent it to HP for a hinge repair and they updated BIOS while it was there. I think that may be the cause of the issue. I can't find the drivers anywhere. It worked for about 15 minutes a week ago and reflected the HP Wide Vision HD Camera driver version 10.0.18362.693, which was up to date. I rebooted and attempted to use the camera the following day, and the driver was gone. I have tried recovering from an external hard drive, doing a Reset and reinstalling Windows 10, and nothing is working.  Please help me get my webcam back.

So, this is a story. I was using my laptop downstairs when I closed the lid (closed perfectly fine, as it had thousands of times) as I had the intention of moving it upstairs. Once upstairs, I attempted to open the lid of the laptop with a sudden cracking noise and extreme resistance when opening the device. I managed to get it open, and I noticed that the bottom right bezel where the HP logo is printed had separation between the plastic and the screen. Glue was visible, and it was extremely hard to open/close the lid because of the plastic wedging between the gap in the screen and the bottom half of the laptop. This literally happened so suddenly, it went from closing perfectly fine to this. I've had this machine for about 2 - 3 years, never had any hardware issues (I did do a SSD swap). Never dropped, screen is not cracked, I used this laptop as my daily driver for school. Is there a way to fix this? *Edit: Forgot to mention the machine is not closable without absolutely ripping out the bezel of the screen.* I attached a video where you can see the issues I am describing.

I have the same situation with my 17z purchased in August of 2017 and the hinge actually broke over this summer, but I did not think about the warranty.  Looks like inadequate engineering with a monitor that large and heavy and plastic support.  Also, I am very disappointed in the performance with the AMD processor and 8gb of ram as it freezes constantly and reboots often.  I gave this to my wife before the screen broke as she has much more patience.  Can this be escalated with HP?

I have had this HP Envy laptop for about 6 years now, The second year right after my warranty expires I hear this odd crack while opening my laptop and lo behold, the left hinge has popped out. Since I couldn't fix the hinge myself or afford it, it has cracked my laptop half open over the years, to the point where I cannot keep the battery in the slot or the computer shocks me. Now it just sits in a keyboard drawer and acts like a desktop, with externals galore attached. So the question is: Can I remove the entire Lid- Screen, Camera, Microphone, and Hinges attached, and still have the computer itself intact? Would it become detected as an open lid, or a closed lid? It would fix the hinge issue.  I have toyed with just chopping it or breaking it off, but I fear that would also break something in the bottom half, given the fact the broken hinge sits right above the power button. Thank you in advance.

I am the owner of an HP ENVY Laptop 13 --Product Number: 8MX92AVTo give you context, it has never been dropped and nothing's every been spilled on it.  This laptop does not leave my office--literally.  It came apart all on it's own! Last week, the rear hinge on my laptop separated so that every time I opened it, the right hinge stuck out.  So in order to close it, I had to manually adjust the hinge to properly close it.  It thereby made a distinct ""clicking"" sound each time I opened or closed the laptop.  I also noticed the lower right corner where the screen is mounted began to separate as it was becoming unglued.  All of these problems originated on the right side of the laptop.   Within 48 hours, opening it gently, my screen detached from the frame and split!  I am at a total loss as to what to do.  I'm currently using my backup 17.3 HP G72 which is well over a decade old and has never given me a single issue.  I purchased this laptop in September 2020 and it is now worthless.  Please help HP!  I'm a loyal customer and I love my computer.

The hinge was weak when I bought it and so I was always gentle opening it. Guess what? -it snapped after the warranty expired! After being driven insane by the “support” pages and virtual agents trying to ascertain my warranty info. I feel there is no other option than to inform the community of my experience in the hope they will decide against purchasing from HP in the future. I merely opened the lid on my Envy and the stupidly designed rubbish just popped apart like it was held together with press studs. it cannot be snapped back together because tiny pieces of brittle plastic (I ask you “what else would one choose for a part under so much stress?”) have broken, leaving the screen to bend agonisingly whenever it is opened and closed. What annoys me most is how HP boast about their product design as if they were great at designing thin notebooks and then refuse to deal with major issues like this.

I purchased my HP Envy X360 in September 2020, and it's been a great machine up until the right hinge broke two days ago.  I heard a crack as I was closing it and now I can't close the lid or open it any further than where it's currently sitting as the right hand hinge no longer pivots and instead distorts the screen and casing around it as it attempts to pop out.  I'm worried that it will crack the screen. Of course this has happened now that it's out of warranty.  It seems to be a common problem but currently my laptop is basically a desktop and that's not what I purchased it for.  Any help on what I can do would be appreciated.

Hi, I have two questions. If I have a hardware issue with my computer do I have to send it with HP care or is there somwehere I could bring my laptop to on my own (like a credited repair centre or something)  so that it doesn't take so long? I use my laptop for studying, I really can't be without it for as long as 10 days, especially since I have tiny issues with it. And on topic of issues, there are two, both kind of cosmetic. One is that the computer gets so warm that the rubber ont he bottom gets unglued and falls off. I already lost one strip and the other is only hanging by the thread. It doesn't exactly prevent me in using the computer in any way, but it's definietly annoying. I don't know if there is any way to fix it, but I would at least like to have new rubber put in. The second one is that my ctrl key broke off. I still have it, but the hinge is broken so I can't attach it back. I don't want to do it on my own in case it voids the warranty, but can I? Does the jey even fall under any cover I have? Or do I have to fix it on my own? Thank you for any help!

I have a Z4P13UA #ABA 17-x115dx notebook works fine, but yesterday I was closing the notebook lid when I heard a loud popping sound. Look at the notebook I notice that the bottom right hand corner of the screen had separated. I was able to that the hinge had broken away from the cover pulling with it the screws and brass holding that were once connected to the cover. I now need to find a place where I can purchase a need LCD screen top cover to replace the now damaged one. I guess one good thing is that the hinge didn't get damage as well. Does anyone know the part number for the plastic cover the house the LCD for a Z4P13UA #ABA 17-x115dx and where one can buy said part for a low cost (I am on a budget that is almost 0, but I need to fix my laptop. It hard to travel with a laptop that you can't close. I really think that the hinge connection point on laptop should be re-enforced considering all the stress those connection point are under with the constant opening and closing of the laptop. A Better benign, a better product. Something as small at that makes a big impact.

Left hinge on my HP 250G6 jammed and broke 16 months after I bought it. The hinge separated the plastic causing the lid not to open or close properly.Although the warranty expires only in eight months, the dealer who sold me the laptop refused to fix the flaw free of charge and offered to repair it for 80€ instead. The service indicated that I was the one who caused the flaw,  although the laptop was never dropped or handled improperly.After the laptop was delivered back to me without being repaired, I called a nearby laptop service in which they told me that hinge jam was a common issue with HP 250G6 line of products.The laptop is now at my home, still broken and unrepaired and therefore unusable. I would like the HP team to help me out of this deadlock.

Hi, i bought the elitebook 1030g3 in november and had to already sent it for repairs because of a broken screen. Now the right hinge on my laptop seems to start to get misaligned. Is this normal?? Im a bit dissapointed by the quality here for a laptop in this price range.I tried the online support service but my serial number is not getting recognised properly (im getting this message: This product is no longer serviced by HP. You may search for possible solutions on this support website.) How can i get this fixed? Thank you very much in advance

My husbands laptop hinge is broken and has caused the corner of his screen to pop out and can’t be closed.  Is there anything we can do to fix this. Repair shop wants 200+ which seems ridiculous. He is in the military and uses this for college. It’s very disappointing considering what we payed for it and how little it’s been used. I’m not sure of exact model atm but it’s touch’s Rene that can be folded to use in tablet mode.

Hi, I'd just like to know what the key hinge model is for the HP OMEN 15-ek0000. Some of my keys have been broken and I'd like to get them repaired manually, however, there is no guide that I could find; can someone either direct me to a guide or tell me the key hinge model? Thank you in advance.

I have an issue that seems to have been and issue for some time and happens a lot with others.My left hinge is broken and the case has seperated. Now because of the left hinge the right one is braking now. With the money that I paid for this custom order, you would think something would have been done before now. I  have seen hundreds if not thousands of people that this has happened too. Has anyone out there received any information from HP about this issue and got help at all? I love this laptop but I am scared that it will be unusable soon.  I can't exactly spend this kind of money on a new one already. Does anyone know what can be done about this?

We bought our university-bound daughter a laptop in the spring of 2021, the Envy 360. We then learned of its hinge issues. While still under warranty, we got it fixed in October 2021. Now August 11, 2022 and without our warranty, the same issue with the hinge is happening again.  We can see in several forums within this HP chat, consumers have been buying these poorly designed laptops since before 2015 yet HP is still selling them now, and then rejecting claims when this hinge issue presents itself again. HP please contact me directly with regard to your own design flaw. We require this to be fixed free of charge as soon as possible, before our daughter returns to university.  Our prior CSO number was BRRS2916-01 for you to verify this information. Thank you,Sonia

I also have a broken left hinge on HP Envy x360and unable to open or close out of fear the screen will crack.  I have made multitudes of phone calls to customer service with no resolve.  One representative claims the hinge is out of stock, another questioned if I did something to the laptop that caused the hinge to break.  I've escalated it and the recommendation is to get a discount for the purchase of another HP laptop!
I am frustrated and extremely disappointed.  What is HP doing for consumers who believed and as such  purchased the HP Envy x360 but now is defective?

Hi, Our HP Laptop is only 1 year old (support/warranty just expired 2 weeks ago on 5/13/21), and the back hinge is defective. When we open and shut it, the case is coming apart at the back left corner. Any good ideas on how to fix this. It stinks because it is only 1 year old and we paid over $500 for it. Ugh. We have always had Dell in the past and never had any issues like this. Thank you for any help you can provide.

Hope this gets to Jeff.  My computer is out of warranty, but I too have a broken hinge.  I can't afford to buy a new laptop after just 2 years,  The hinge started giving me trouble very quickly, but I had no idea it would just continue to get worse!  If anyone could tell me how to contact Jeff that would be wonderful.  He seems to be the only one willing to help.  Thanks so much!

I bought an HP Pavillion x360 on January 2022 and my product is under warranty period. On 8th September 2022, all of a sudden when I opened the laptop I saw a crack on the right side near the hinge and a black color spread along the screen from the hinge side. I was really surprised and disappointed seeing this from a brand like HP. Then I contacted HP service via your WhatsApp number. They raised a case on my behalf of me on 8th September 2022 and they informed me as they will give the quotation within 24 to 48 hours. I didn't get any quotation even after the mentioned time. Hence I contacted HP, again and again, more than 6 times, and each time they assure me that I will get the quotation within 24 hours. After 10 days, till now I didn't get any response. This is not the service I'm expecting from a reputed brand like HP.  I would like to bring to your attention that this kind of screen breaking without any physical force is not an isolated issue. I'm attaching some of the links in community posts with the same issue. Day by day the number of cracks is increasing and the black color is spreading without doing anything. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Pavilion-x-360-Screen-Crack...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Pavilion-x360-display-hinge...https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/Broken-Hinge-Screen-HP-Pavilion-X360/...

So I previously posted about help and got no where with HP. Several other people reached out to ask if I had found a solution. and since I finally did I wanted to update the thread. Luckily, my sister builds electronic components for a living so I made her do the repair but after watching her I'm sure anyone else could. She used a tool to pop my plastic frame from around my screen off to diagnose what was going on. It wasn't hard to pull apart but she used a separator tool to make sure the plastic tabs didn't break. Only 1 screw was used on each side of the metal hinge. The other screws used were screwed into thin plastic that couldn't handle the tension of the lid being pulled open and all had broken away from the plastic. The hinges themselves were over tightened during assembly. She said when the parts are assembled there is a calibrated drill they are suppose to use to tightened things like screws and hinges so this doesn't happen. She said it was either not calibrated correctly or the person didn't use the tool at all and used a hand tool. Either way a bunch of fumbles on HP's end is absolutely causing this problem. So the fix... its not ideal but it works. Since the plastic screws were not salvageable the only way to relieve the pressure was to loose the hinges. There is a very thin line of tension the screen can handle before the frame wants to pop apart and the lid flops open and close too freely. She had to repeatedly tighten and test the tension. She used a pair of needle nose pliers to tighten the end bolt. Then  cut a few strips of black electrical tape and ran them vertically down and around the frame on the outermost side of the hinge to reinforce the lid from wanting to separate. Not great I know but now my laptop is usable again.

Around 2 years after purchasing my OMEN, the part of the right hinge inside of the chassis attached to the screen broke off, and popped off. The warranty ran out a year ago and it seems a lot of people are having this same issue. However, after spending hours calling HP it seems that there is nothing they can do for me without charging me an absurd price of £220+. After spending almost £1k on this laptop I am extremely disappointed and I don't think I'll ever buy from HP again. Doesn't seem right to me that I have to pay for a defect, after going through hoops and hours of customer ""support"".

I bought this Laptop in Nov 2019 for my daughter, it has never left the house (mainly sitting on her desk)and has been lightly used, until COVID and home schooling, it was used probably about once a week. It’s out of warranty.A couple of days ago one of the hinges broke, after looking into this I see it’s only made of plastic. Which I can not believe they make a major working part in this way. I have had laptops by other makes and never had this issue. surely this is a design fault? Any views /help as I’m very disappointed in a company that I’ve always had good products from in the past.

My 83 year old mom has a 15"" HP Envy touchsmart that I purchased for her almost exactly 3 years ago. Over time the hinges (right side in particular) have gotten stiff and the other day when she opened it, the right hinge broke its way out of the display frame. I have read that this is a very common problem. I have been in I.T. for over 20 years and have repaired many laptops, so I simply want to know where to purchase replacement parts, and which parts to order, since HP seems to be aware of this issue, but does nothing to help.  Rather than fight about it I just want to fix it. Thank you.

Hi,  I've recently had a problem with my HP Omen whereas the hinge appears to have snapped, in order to stop the broken hinge from completely breaking the case I unscrewed the hinge and folded it down. Since doing this the case on the opposite corner of the laptop has formed a crack in it and the laptop case now bends pretty horribly whenever the laptop of moved or the lid closed. The laptop is pretty much unusable at the moment as I don't want to move it too much and potentially break the case any more. Is there anywhere I can get a replacement hinge and case cover from?

This is in response to the 2014 post, ""HP Envy 17"" Left Hinge and Casing,"" and I'm posting here b/c I'm not able to reply in that thread (maybe HP got tired of hearing about it?) as well as 2017 thread by one of the HP User. I bought  HP Envy X360  Convertible about a year and a half ago. Everything was working fine. I was a very happy customer up until now. The left hinge completely broke and the plastic piece detached. When I close the laptop I can place it back on, but when I open it up it pops off again and makes popping noises. I want you guys to know that I have taken really good care of the machine. I never had a single problem until this morning. I have taken gentle care and have been using the machine for regular user's usage that do not include shutting down the computer frequently. Thus, there was no way the left hinge would have broken the way it is. Moreover, I have not applied any extra pressure that causes that to happen.  I'm concerned that this will only get worse over time and am worried about the potential internal damage this could cause.I have read a number of threads regarding the same issue caused on the same device over the period of time since 2014 throughout until now. It really calls into question HP's brand and the quality of their products. I assume my warranty is expired. And it's very suspicious that this happened just at the year mark, about a month or so after my warranty expired. This seems to have been a known problem since 2014 (almost 6 years!) with no solutions for customers. The only option I've seen is a repair at around $150- $300, which I think is outlandish to pay and insulting to customers. This is not an average breakdown. This is clearly a design flaw, a defect, that HP wants its customers to pay for, which calls into question the integrity of the company. I'm a software engineer and coding on the laptop is the primary goal that requires a lot of good hardware and software and expects it to be working fine. HOWEVER, HP IS CLEARLY NOT DELIVERING IT!!!!  Again, I am sure I will receive a generic reply from the moderator. It really questions how HP takes care of its customers now.

I purchased HP ENVY 13-aq0011ms Laptop in December 2019. After using about 1 year, (I treated it very gently all the time), the issue started: when the screen of the laptop is being moved to open/close, the chassis of the bottom case pops and split-opens. See attached photo.   I've done some research and found that many Envy users report the same kind of hinge issues. It is indeed a common issue for the HP Envy series, and apparently this is a design flaw.  This kind of hinge issue will likely get worse soon, potentially disabling the laptop completely. This is not the design/build quality one would expect for the expensive line of HP laptops. I use this laptop every day for work, and also given the pandemic situations, I'm not sure what should be the best course of action to address this problem. Maybe there's some self-repair kit/parts HP can send me? Or some quick drop/pick repair solution somewhere? Please help, HP! I would expect more from HP's higher-end line laptops! Thanks.

First HP laptop and after less than 2 years, the left hinge has broken. I have kept this laptop on my desk for the last few weeks and have never used it in tablet mode during this time. Upon opening the lid up this morning, I heard a crack and noticed the left hinge had separated from the screen. The laptop will not close. Luckily the computer is working fine (until who knows when), but this seems to be a recurring issue for many people with this laptop. As I'm about a year out of warranty, I wonder if HP will acknowledge that this is a manufacturing issue and fix it without charging an outrageous price as I've read in other posts. I am going back to school in a few weeks, and it's crazy that a hinge breaks loose while it's literally sitting on a desk (it's summer vacation). Hopefully the company owns up to this, since it's clearly a design issue. A hinge shouldn't break off an $800 laptop after only 2 years of use. Definitely will never buy another HP laptop or product again, as they are a terrible option for students who need a functional laptop that'll last more than a couple of years.

I purchased this laptop in April 2019 the fan was loud right out of the box. This was the first time I had this happen. Thought it would rectify itself for some reason. Started getting fan messages and laptop shutting down. I went on vacation without the laptop, came back three weeks later and the hinge starts to separate. Laptop is under warranty, take it to a HP repair center an hour away from me, which is the closet center. HP refuses to repair the hinge! There is clearly no damage to the laptop externally it was never dropped and did not get excessive use as I work long hours and was gone for almost a month on vacation. I am so disappointed that I missed my 30-day return window with the merchant. I have had previous problems with the hinges with all of my 17"" HP laptops, but not in less than a month!? I had assumed it was something I did at some point, but clearly there is a manufacturer defect in the hinges. I am so disappointed as I have been purchasing HP products faithfully for years. I feel duped! Could someone offer some assistance in getting these pricey repairs done?

The laptop still works perfectly fine and I can use it, however the hinge prevents me from closing it or even adjusting the screen even slightly. The hinge has separated from the screen in the back. Every time I try to adjust the screen it is  pulling apart the casing around the screen of the laptop. I understand that it is likely not going to be possible to fix this without paying, but is there anything I can do to fix it even slightly? It is very inconvenient as I can't bring my laptop anywhere and I have to be incredibly careful whenever moving it.

I purchased a 13"" HP Envy x360 for use at the new job I started in March 2022.  The machine has spent the majority of its life on my work desk, with carrying it to conference rooms on rare occasions.  Yesterday, when opening the lid, the hinge on the right side made a snapping sound and pushed through the screen itself (the screen is separating from the shell on that corner).  The screen is not damaged, but the hinge does not function and I am concerned with any slight movement may crack the screen. It appears this issue is well-known, as I have seen multiple posts on the issue here and hardware sites as well as a class action lawsuit filed late last year (later withdrawn).  There are even a few official HP Service videos on how to replace the display panel hinge (most manufacturers don't want you to take your hardware apart).  I don't have a way to source the replacement part(s) though. Other than this issue, the computer has been great.  I went to the closest UBreakiFix (an HP Service Center location), and they informed me that they have seen the issue many times, and unfortunately they cannot order the necessary part and cannot help me,  They recommended reaching out to HP directly for help.  This is a huge bummer. I've seen many instances of this exact issue being brought up in the Community, and in most cases an HP Support Agent has reached out to the poster directly to help resolve the issue.  I am hoping for that to be the case here.  Thank you!

I have an HP Envy 13"" laptop, approx. 9 months old, where the hinges started to feel strange after a while. Eventually i could not open it at all and i send it in to HP (handled by Elcare Nordic here in Sweden) to get it fixed under warranty. Now they want me to pay $350 for a full screen replacement as the screen 'is broken'. My impression is that any problem with the screen was caused by badly designed hinges on this machine. Paying $350 is not an option considering the value of the laptop forcing me to to get a new non-HP laptop instead. Anybody with some references to documented issues with the hinges on this model? Or is it just me?

The hinge on my 12 month old $1000 laptop just failed and popped out the bottom of my screen. It looks like the plastic around the hinge just disintegrated from the metal screws/hinge in hinge assembly.  Looks like this is a known failure of design (see the many links below full of pages and pages of people reporting the exact same issue) - and HP is trying to charge 1/3rd of the price of the laptop to fix it. I need this laptop for work and it is unusable in this state.

I and my brother bought the same type of laptop in 2017. We had a good memory using hp products before. His hinge broke a year ago, and mine broke about 6 months ago. We did not put any physical pressure or damage on the laptop, that's why I think it is the problem is the product's durability. Is there a way to get help from this?

Hi, The hinge on my laptop broke pretty much as the warrant ran out (in under a year).

I assume it’s a bit of plastic from the hinge fixture as I have found loose bits of plastic trapped in there before, but I can’t fix this one. I’m not sure what to do as I can’t just glue the plastic back together. please help!!

I am not able to close and open the laptop properly as I fear that it would completely destroy my laptop.

I bought a HP Envy X360 convertible on November, 2020. That laptop cost me around 900 bucks. My experience with the laptop was good until about a week ago, when the right hinge broke for no apparent reason while opening the laptop, two of the screws came out from that area and the screen around that hinge cracked and also cracked the screen around it. I did contact with one of the spokespeople from HP immediately, but to my dismay I was informed that it's reparable but I have to pay around 400 which is basically half the cost of the original product, as the warranty period was over 6 months ago. I can guarantee that I haven't mishandled the product in any way at all and the otherwise mint condition of the device can prove that claim. In the above circumstance, I am soliciting any suggestions/recommdation regarding what I am supposed to do now with this laptop. Going through the community I have come to know that this is a common design problem in hp laptops and I would sincerely appreciate if anyone from HP or user community can enlighten me with their experience and advice.

Hello!I purchased my HP Envy x360 August 2020. It has always worked fine with no issue. Today, I went to flip it over so I could use it as a tablet and the bottom right hinge broke. My computer still works but I cannot flip it over. The bottom right corner of my screen looks like it is cracked open. Is there any way I can fix this issue?

What causes a hinge to break on left side of HP Envy x360?   My computer is out of warranty now (2 years old) but this appears to be a problem that others have also had with this computer, so is like a manufacturing defect.Will this cause the computer screen to separate and then become unusable?  Has anyone found a solution?  HP, can you hear me???

I had bought the HP Envy 15 from my local Costco on 6/21/18 and everything works perfectly fine on my laptop and is a great laptop but on 1/15/19 the left hinge on my laptop broke while I was closing the laptop screen, which then resulted in the bottom left part of the screen to crack. I called HP and was told to send pictures of the screw that fell out from the hinge, and pictures of the screen where it is cracked. I sent the pictures through email and the HP worker told me there is nothing the warranty could cover because the damage is not a manufacturing issue, when in reality I did nothing wrong but tried to close my laptop. I need this laptop for my college and work and I cannot afford to pay the price they are asking for to repair the laptop although it is not even my fault and is clearly a manufacturing issue. I went on to do a little bit of research and sure enough, there were many, many other complaints of their HP Envy laptop’s hinge breaking through normal use. I am extremely upset with this issue.

Hello, I have had this HP Envy Laptop for a couple years and I love it! It's only used at home, has never been dropped, charges on a desk and has very little wear and tear. When I was adjusting the screen the other day the plastic casing that holds the screen detached from the screen itself.  I was tilting the screen toward me and the back panel split.   The computer still works if the screen is at a very specific angle. However, it no longer closes or opens, and if the screen is too far back it will just fall back. Any advice on how to fix it would be hugely appreciated! I love HP, and have always had HPs, both laptops and desktops, but this is super weird and is making it very difficult to use this laptop.

I saw that this topic has already been discussed for a while but it was ""resolved"" so I could not reply to it.My laptop for the most part sits on my desk. Every once in a while I close it but not often. Recently after closing the lid and opening it again later the screen did exactly what many others have described...the left hinge broke then causing the screen to crack open. I now leave the lid open at all times or else risk further damage. Of course my laptop is now about 22 months old and I did not purchase an extension on the warranty. If I had know that this was a known issue for literally YEARS now I would have opted to extend it.  I am hoping someone can provide some direction to get this resolved.

I bought a HP Envy Laptop last year. I sent it back for repair because there was a cracking noise on the speakers. It sounded like a hardware issue but the technician told me it was a software issue and installed in the OS. Since it came back it blue-screened very frequently. Then, one day the hinge came out of the back for no reason and a few days later the whole laptop died. I brought it back to the retailer who told me it would cost MORE than the price I paid for it to be repaired and I should throw it out. I only bought it LAST YEAR! I have tried to contact HP but I cannot find ANY WAY to contact them! Surely they must be required to have a representation for post-sale issues. Otherwise this is a big concern for anyone buying HP.

The hinge has snapped on my HP ENVY X360 causing the screen to crack. This happened when I simply closed the lid of my laptop. Upon research I have found many others to complain of the exact same problem. The hinges are cheap and faulty. I am a student so need a laptop for my studies however the current cost to get it fixed is aprox £300-400, all for an issue due to a faulty laptop. Having been in contact with HP support I have been told there is nothing they can do. This is disgraceful and I highly recommend that no one buy this laptop.

When our community flooded, I replaced my computer with this laptop. I primarily use it for both teaching at school and lesson preparation at home. The stiff hinges have now caused the top left surface to crack near the power button. Since the warranty is now passed, I tried to continue using it as is. However when I adjust the screen angle, many times the laptop will go into shutdown mode because the hinge has damaged this area by the switch. I’ve researched online that this is an unusually  common problem in this series of laptops. Is there anyone who can help me with this. I desperately need this laptop to work for my classes.

Hi All and HP if you are listening, I have 4 HP Laptops in the family and 2 of these are HP Envy 6 1080ex model laptops brought for 2 of my sons at university and both have now broken their hinges.  The first one we were told by HP that as out of warranty it they would sell us new cases for US$00's of dollars even though this is widely known as a design flaw / fault.  So we fixed the first one by drilling 2 holes in the aluminum lid and screwing the hinge that was only previously 'glued', yes I did say 'glued' by HP to the lid.  The hinges themselves are quite stiff and so even after winding down the tension on the hinge, this laptop hinge has now succeeded in ripping the screws out of the base enclosure moldings on one side.  This laptop is in New Zealand.   The second laptop has broken by tearing the glued hinge off the lid and we are waiting for our electrician to drill the holes in this laptop lid to temporarily fix this one.  I say a temp fix as we know that eventually this one will too rip apart and separate from the base enclosure.  This laptop is in England at the moment.   I have upgraded the RAM and also they both have 1TB hybrid hard drives so they actually work very well and quite fast, and the screens and sound is great.  It would be a shame to have to bin off both laptops when the only thing wrong with them is the HP designed cases.  Can anyone or HP yourselves assist us please?  Given the age of the laptops, albeit that they have been upgraded I would not expect to get these fixed at no charge however still maintain that this exact fault was occurring to these laptops within 3 months to 6 months of use all around the world so HP should really be stepping up to the plate and providing replacement housings with hinges attached to a lid in a way that will not break off in the first few years of use.  I look forward to hearing back from the community or HP.  If I don't hear back from HP with a amicable solution that solves this then as one of my son's is commencing his masters degree in 6 weeks I will need to buy a new laptop and sadly it won't be an HP.   Best Regards, TE.

I have 5 HP laptops and I am a loyal HP customer. I have now had 2 HP Envy 360 with broken left hinge. My Sons and my Wife’s 15” laptop. They are in excellent condition pampered with not even a scratch anywhere. Rubber Feet peeled of, very poor design on both. Then all of a sudden the hinge popped and the screen popped while opened the screen. Plastic tiny parts fell off. I couldn’t believe it. Both of them did the same thing. Not even opened the laptops as tablets ever for what they were designed for. Paid thousands for these laptops and now rendered useless.  Clearly HP knows about the issue and seems like it is fixing these laptops. As a mechanical engineer, I see the design as seriously poorly designed. Metal fingers that are held down by cheap plastic.  I have other brand laptops older and more rugged. Nothing like this. HP tech support, I hope you have a revised design cause I just spent 1000 on another one and now I am worried about the same issue happening. 
HP, please contact me to remedy this issue please! Now my Wife’s and my Sons laptop are useless (top of the line hardware but really poor design).

First off, I treat all of my devices with great care. I work for a tech company and my devices are my livelihood. A week ago my laptop suffered some internal damage. I opened it up one day and there were cracks on the inside of my screen. There is no physical damage to the exterior of the device but the screen is unusable. 
 
So I am facing some serious problems with HP support representatives and service partners in South Africa trying to get down to what's going on with the device and case. 
 
A week ago I took the device to the partnered service centre in Cape Town, South Africa called Ensure Services. They told me that it would not be covered under warranty because it was customer-induced damage. I explained to them that the hinge/screen build on this model is not optimal or not designed well (weak) which caused internal damage to the screen while it was being opened or whatever the case may be. I told them I would leave it with them (after being charged a deposit) and that I would contact HP directly in the meantime to discuss the issue. 
 
I called HP  support and was redirected and sent back and forth to multiple different departments and branches, having to constantly re-explain myself. In the end, I was told that they needed to troubleshoot the device to confirm what I was stating. I told support that HP partner, Ensure Services has the device and that they should be able to communicate this with them directly. I was told that your support will not contact Ensure Services (which is bizarre since they are an accredited partner of HP) and that I have to go get the device back from them. I was getting frustrated at this point.

 
So I got in my car for the second time during my work day and went to retrieve my laptop from Ensure Services (it was with them for under 2 hours). I drove back home and called HP support for troubleshooting and after some more redirection across different departments and waiting on hold, began a video live stream to show my issue. Yet again, I was told that the damage was caused by me. Great. Even though it is clear that there is no damage to the front panel of the screen or any other external part of the device. Powered off - there isn't a scratch to be seen. If I cracked, knocked, dropped, or did anything to this device by accident. Surely there would be some kind of mark or damage to be seen?
 
I logged a complaint and was given a case number. 
 
I have been going back and forth with support ever since having to explain myself again and again. I was called back by a few different representatives for follow-ups. Each one of them didn't have all the information on my case and didn't even know about the troubleshooting video. I was asked to record a video again myself and email it (which I don't think is normal). This entire process has cost me so much time and energy that I'm frankly at a loss for words and have no intention of purchasing another HP product ever again. At this point, I seek to warn my peers and colleagues against HP now. 
 
Now I'm getting more emails confirming that the damage will be listed as customer induced because Ensure Services conducted a diagnosis of my device (all of a sudden they now are able to contact Ensure Services...). What baffles me is the fact that the laptop was with Ensure Services for less than 2 hours! They state that it takes them between 2-3 days to diagnose a device. I highly doubt that any diagnostics took place and that they are all just trying to cover their poor communications and mishandling of my case. I received an email with the report days after retrieving my device stating that there is no physical damage but my back cover, LCD panel, and hinges need replacing. How on earth does this make sense? Furthermore, I was notified that my laptop was diagnosed today and received an outrageous quotation that makes no mention of the hinge replacement.. Ensure Services only had my laptop for 2 hours and I retrieved it from them a full week ago - the same day I dropped it off (as per requested by your support team).
 
I believe that the support team handling my case and Ensure Services have completely disregarded the procedure and process that is meant to be followed and as a result, I have a laptop that's broken which wasn't caused by me, yet I'm being manipulated into paying for a device repair even though it's under warranty. It seems that HP is doing everything in its power to force me to pay for my laptop's repairs.
 
Either this gets covered under warranty or paid for by HP or I will never be purchasing/recommended another HP product or service in the future.
 
It's clear to me that this was caused by a design fault in the device's build - the screen and mount are poorly designed and this is what caused my screen to get damaged so easily. This should not have happened for the price I paid for the device! I can link youtube reviews and forum posts that specifically focus on the poor build quality of the screen for reference. There are plenty more where this came from.

A year and a half ago I paid INR 75,000 and bought HP's premium laptop HP EnvyX360. Now The screen of the laptop could not be closed due to jamming of the right side hinge of the laptop within a year and a half. Also the screw of the hinge came out of the gap between the screen and the back cover. So the glass protection cover of the display was also damaged because of it. However, the touch pad and screen are working fine.I contacted HP customer care after this problem occurred, but got poor response from them. As a result, an incorrect quotation of the total repairing cost of 37 thousand rupees was given from customer care and HP service center. In which, hinges of INR 5,000, display panel of INR 22,000 and back cover replacement of INR 8,000 were mentioned.However, I disagreed with this. Because HP Inc has previously admitted that all of HP's premium laptops have manufacturing defects that cause hinge problems. Also, as the company made claims in the marketing and advertisement of the laptops to attract customers, all the claims are false. As the company has stated in the specifications of its laptop, the laptop does not use a strong metal material. Plastic material has been used instead. Due to which these so-called premium laptops are not as premium as their price.I've seen hundreds of post regarding this issue. And HP accept this is company Manufacturing Defect, Then why HP is not Providing Service? Also the case was registered in court regarding this issue. So Please Help me regarding this.

Hello ,I am not able to close my laptop at all because the hinge is broken and it tears down the bezel along with it as a result i should keep my monitor stationary with some support behind to hold it steady.I am unable to carry my laptop anywhere as i cannot close it and it damages every time if tried to do so.So i need help as how to proceed ,can it be repaired without any replacement or needs to be changed as a whole set? If so how much will be the cost in either case?Thanks

My laptop's left hinge one day just started crackling when I went to close my laptop.  I don't know how this could have happened because I take extremely good care of my laptop, so it is almost definitely not an error on my part.  What further supports this is that my family has had a similar problem with the left hinge on another HP laptop breaking.  That was an inexpensive laptop that lasted forever so we accepted that something would go wrong eventually, but I have barely had this laptop for over a year and already I cannot close my laptop.  At this point the screen is no longer level, the cover is peeling off of the screen, I cannot close my laptop without the risk of further damage, and the left hinge is essentially useless.  I would appreciate any help especially because it is most likely a craftsmanship issue rather than a mistreatment issue.  Thank you for your time.

Hello, I bought the 17-BY1008CA less than a year ago.  Is it possible to have my laptop fixed without charge due to the hinges failing?The way the laptop has been designed the entire weight of the monitor is resting on two hinges that are attached to cheap plastic.  It is basically designed so that if the laptop is open the weight slowly pulls the screws out of where they are attached and pushes up through the housing causing everything to break. HP must know this.  I can't be the first person to have this happen. It is literally a design flaw.My laptop sits on my desk or on my lap in my home.  It is lifted by the bottom using two hands.  It has not been abused in any way.   I have to use clamps to hold it together as it has already snapped the housing.  I spent $700 on this laptop it should not break by itself.  I had bought another HP laptop 20 years ago and the same thing happened.  Even planned obsolescence should last longer than 8 months.  I have never had this happen with the multiple Acers and Lenovos that I have owned.

I'm trying to find out if there is any kind of solution for this issue, which seems to be very widespread. Several months ago, 2 days before my last semester of school, my hinge broke and the screen split as I opened the lid. Keep in mind I had NEVER used it as a tablet or opened it other than as a normal laptop. I had the computer for a year and a half at that point, so of course it was out of warranty. I didn't have time to send it off or take it to have it repaired, so I bought a new computer. Now that I'm done with school, I went to a local repair shop to get an estimate on what it would take to fix it. I was told the back cover would need to be replaced along with the hinges, so with labor, it will cost me $360 FOR A COMPUTER I PAID OVER 900 DOLLARS FOR 18 MONTHS PRIOR! So now I'm stuck with a broken computer that I can't afford to fix? I have a very pricy paperweight. Is HP seriously not going to acknowledge they really messed up with the design of these laptops? The guy at the repair shop started nodding as soon as I said the words ""envy"" and ""hinge."" As much as these machines cost, you should recall them for the faulty hardware/design. I'm livid about this and will definitely avoid HP products from now on because this is ridiculous and pathetic. I'll also be certain to let EVERYONE know what I experienced. Adding to my frustration, I couldn't even reply to others with the exact same problem. It also took 10 minutes of searching to find out how to post on this forum. It's the most non user friendly forum I've ever encountered. So, if anyone has found this from googling, RUN in the other direction. My computer performed beautifully...too bad I can't open or close it.

The right side hinge has unfortunately broken on my 4 year old HP Envy (dv7-7335ea).  Other than this issue it's been a great machine, but I understand that a broken hinge is not an uncommon problem with this model. It is possible for HP to supply a replacement base enclosure so I can repair this myself (Part No. 707999-001)? Thanks in advance for your help.

My issue is identical.  The separation totally destroyed the air vent on the left side of my Envy TS 17.  Each time I open it, black plastic breaks from the vent area.  This is all around the power button so I wouldn't be surprised if the computer fails to turn on in the near future.  In addition to that the disk drive isn't recognized by the computer.  I think that something has been disconnected.
 
Was this issue resolved with HP?

Hello there  In brief about the story of my purchase and after about the current situation. Puchased a year ago when the laptop just came out in the market. Arrived with some manufacturing faults on the hinges and some coil whine sound, sounded like it was about to crack. Sent back within 2 days of receiving and got a new one. The change process took approx  3.5 weeks as there was no one to answer my calls, public holidays began right after I sent the faulty one for exchange...  Now about the new product: Same problem with hinges. Compared to old laptop, the new one is impossible to open with one hand right from the begining. My guess was that hinges were screwed so tight that the screen was not opening smoothly without the help of second hand by hold down the keyboard part... After the frustration with changing the product first time, I just ignored that small thing as well as the coil whine sound which persists on this unit as well, and decided to use this unit as it is. Now the hinge is making similiar noise when bending the screen to tablet mode, and it has become more intense comared to when I got the laptop. It is like a sound of friction between two metals, seems like it should be oiled to make the movement smoothers. I would ignore it further if it didn't make crackling sound.  Here we begin now  1)Laptop condition:  Perfect (never droped, no scratch, no dents, always in its leather case when not used, turned off when not used)Remarks: The color came off yesterday from the screw, left speaker side. I never touched it with a screw driver... color just peeled off. 2)Hinge problem - I don't know what is going on under that hinge cover but something is wrong. First time 2/20/2019: Laptop was running > I have turned it into ""V ""shape to watch a movie > After a while i tried to increase the volume through side buttons > The system didn't respond to my commands > Left it for a while to see if it was a system lagg > Tried again to increase volume and no response > Tried to bring the latop to normal stand > very strong crackling sound on spot.Remarks: I know how it sounds when a fully loaded laptop fan touches the walls while you turn the laptop, this was not a normal sounds, more like something is broken or something broke and that part went into the turning fan. Second time 2/21/2019, Laptop was on the table > Screen half way open > Turned it on and wanted to adjust the screen position to normal > Crackling sound right on spot, again from the same place.Remarks: i tried to play around, bending the screen to 360x to tablet mode while holding vertically and horizontaly, to check if the sound will repeat, it didn't.   3)Screen Flickering on Internet Explorer Edge when watchin Youtube - pausing and playing the video while fullscreen, flickering stops only when i close the browser and open it again.  I have seen this problem on the first unit that was exchanged. The new unit has it as well but I decided to use it further as now I know how to avoid it. I am sure the problem is not in the speakers, I did some speaker checkup in the system, status was OK.System Diagnostic checkup with ""HP Assistant"" - no issues found Al possible system/BIOS drivers up to date, checked with ""HP Assistance"" and ""Windows Updates"" - latest check 2/21/2019. Performed ""Hardware and Device"" Troubleshooting (screenshots attached) - whatever was wrong it must have been fixed... maybe. Tried to run HP PC Hardware Diagnostics -  Program doesn't load (screenshots attached) I waited for around 40 minutes at least see the menue options, no change, it just keeps loading. https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Software-and-How-To-Questions/Hp-PC-Hardware-Diagnostics-does... Tried the steps as explained in this topic, still doesn't load. Uninstalled/Re-installed no result.  I still got 1 year and 11 months of Care Pack and I don't want to wait till the very last month to report a latop that breaks down slowly  Please suggest what to do Purchased from Swiss, I am in UK right now Do I have a chance to ship it to you for complete Hardware checkup from A to Z under warranty coverage? Thanks in advance,  Tigran

My husband, who is an attorney, and not a college kid throwing his laptop hither and yon, just showed me his laptop hinges.  The right hinge had been ""temperamental"" for a while, maybe a year? and had to be gently closed because it would ""pop"" out of place.  Now, the *left* hinge is completely crunched, with tiny screws and bits of broken plastic falling out.  The outside edge is so twisted he can't even plug in the charger now.  The laptop won't even open more than a few inches now, either. This is a laptop that was never dropped or abused in any way, and was actually purchased when we were in quarantine and my husband started working from home, so it never left the house (even though it has a nice padded case to travel in!)
 
We are both disgusted beyond belief, esp. after seeing that this is *not* a problem unique to us.  We live on Staten Island, and would have to travel to Brooklyn or Manhattan to go to the nearest ubreakifix, and the prices other people were quoted ($200-300) are *insane* for a laptop that cost $479 in the first place.
 
In addition, this laptop is used by my husband for his work as an attorney, and he is not going to leave it overnight or mail it to anyone.  It needs to be repaired in front of him...people's private legal business would be at risk otherwise.  At any rate, we are *not* even bothering with opening a support ticket with HP; having read about the merry-go-round of uselessness other people have gone through, we are going straight to the top.  [Email Removed]

Never taken the laptop outside since I purchased this during the pandemic as an upgrade for my existing laptop. One day, I opened it and I found some black plastic pieces on the side of the laptop. With more use, more and more black plastic pieces appeared and I had more trouble opening the laptop. I found out it is actually the plastic that was supposed to hold the metal hinge together. I found some other online posts with similar experiences. I contacted customer service and was told that I had passed the 1-year warranty for like 3 (or 5?) days. I don't know what to do with that piece of information. I asked if there is any way to extend it for a few days and the customer service said no.  I am not sure what to do now.

  I purchased a DV7 – 7030us, on July 3, 2012 from Amazon.com.  A few months after the warranty period was over I began experiencing problems with the hinges.  That problem continued to progress to the point where the left hinge is now entirely out of the case and it is apparent that the right hinge will soon follow.  I can provide photos.  I did a bit of research on the web and found that hinge problems are common with models of this type but that there has not been a recall, nor has a general warranty extension been issued by HP.  My previous laptop was also an HP, a DV9920, and it too had hinge failure, to the degree that I purchased aftermarket hinges and made the repair myself.  Ultimately that computer was retired because the power connection failed.  It is surprising to me that a company of the size and sophistication of HP would not have addressed the hinge issues long before this.  I have owned many HP products over the years, mostly printers, and found them to be of good quality; but I would like you to provide me with appropriate relief for the current hinge problem, by which I mean that the laptop should be returned to you for repair at your expense. Please contact me with your proposed solution.  Regards, Thomas J.

The ribbon cable came loose from it's solder point on the touchpad board , so I being cheap tried to resolder the original cable and succeeded only to find it's now barely.. literally barely too short to reach the connector a week later and 20$ less in my account I spliced it with silver conductive epoxy and have it reconnected I'm feeling a little better about the situation and I'm putting the laptop back together, the pain in the ass it is and it's tight nooks and crannies, I hear a strange ping and my heart drops as I discover two prongs have broken loose in what I guess would be a middle point of the wire inside a small plastic black cube on the motherboard itself I have no clue what this component is and I'm at my end with this endeavor if anyone could please identify this for my knowledge and possible next course of action.

I have an HP envy x360.As it is an expensive laptop I took very good care of it.But for my luck the left hinge broken apart two days back.I didn't even put much pressure on my laptop anytime.Now it gives me a feel like the whole screen will come off on the left. I have never dropped it  or done anything to my laptop.Then I googled about the same problem and discovered its really a very common problem with every laptop of this kind from you. As of right now i am not using it because the hinge has completely been exposed from the laptop. Hope you guys do something about it without escalating it further

I see there are already a ton of posts about this issue, I very rarely even use my laptop, it has had very minimal use but it is now out of warranty and the left hinge is broken on the screen. It is ridiculous how many people are having this exact same issue, I paid way too much money for this laptop for it to break so easily and so quickly without even having much use on it. Is this problem being addressed by HP?

I have a HP Pavilion - 15z-cw000 CTO, which the warranty ended 2 months ago. The hinge holding the screen together on the right side popped and broke. Looking through the forum it appears to be a common problem. Is there a standard fix for this? It is virtually useless after just over a year? This is extremely frustrating. Any help would be greatly appreciated as my daughter depends on this for school.

I have HP Envy x360 m Convertible that the right hinge has separated from the display. My laptop sits on a desk and is used only by me so I know that there has been no misuse. The laptop has NEVER been moved, transported and by no means dropped. I simply close the cover when it isn’t being used and although it is a convertible, I have NEVER rotated the screen that far. I purchased the laptop a little over two years ago so it is out of warranty. If I actually rotated the display 360 degrees, I am sure the hinge and even the display would have broken well before the warranty expired.I called HP and it would cost over $400.00 to have it repaired. My screen is not cracked (as I noticed the problem when I started opening it) and I told the repair specialist that twice during the call. Over $400 to repair a hinge that is a design flaw? No thank you!This issue is a very common problem and HP is just making money off of consumers with these repairs. Why would any engineer think that a hinge secured by a screw in PLASTIC be a good idea? It is definitely to make more money on consumers. A laptop costing over $800.00 should last more than 2 years. If I have the repair completed, it will be a laptop costing me $1200.00. There should be a recall on these laptops.I am disgusted by this and will never buy HP again.

We have received your product at our repair center and evaluated the problem. The service required to fix the issue is not covered by warranty either due to accidental damage or the warranty has expired. Details of your product and the price for service are as follows: Model Description: HP ENVY X360 CONVERTIBLE 15M-EE0013DXService Status:: Accidental DamagePrice: $637.23 (includes taxes). I bought the HP Envy 4 months ago and have never taken it off of my desk besides to plug it in to play movies occasionally.  Opened it one day - normally - to hear a super loud crack and of course the entire hinge is hanging by a thread.  The plastic that the hinge is connected to has completely cracked off.  It looks like too much torque is being put on these two hinges. Sent the laptop in for repair and they said it was a customer issue and that I had to pay $630 to get the laptop fixed.  It cost me $660 to purchase the entire thing.  4 months ago. Honestly I would bite the bullet if it was my fault but truly it wasnt.  Does HP not stand by their manufacturer's warranty?  Is there anything I can do to get them to fix this? I cant believe this is happening.  This is my 3rd HP product and could be my last.

I purchased my HP Envy 360 9 months ago (December 3rd, 2018). I have been very happy with it until this morning when unexpectedly, the hinge broke and cracked the screen. My daughter uses this laptop for school, but only on a desk and has never mistreated it. I purchased an HP based on my positive experience with our HP Printer and numerous HP laptops, but this seems to be a manufacturing defect as this is a known problem and has been posted about numerous times within this forum as well as other places on the internet. I'm still inside my 1-year P&L warranty, but I'm being told it's going to cost (estimated) $300 to fix. Being that this is a regularly reported and known issue I would greatly appreciate it if HP could repair my computer and address this issue via a recall or redesign. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

One of the hinges on my HP ENVY 360 just broke, bulging the lower left side of my screen. I have read that this is a common problem and several class action lawsuits have been filed on this. The laptop is only almost 2 years old, never dropped, never mistreated. Even thou it is out of warranty, this is obviously a design problem. What are the options HP would offer me?

Hi, Terribly frustrating interaction with HP support on the telephone, my 4 year old computer is considered end of life, and no effective support is available.  I need a new battery, and the left hinge has broken away from the back cover of the machine.   I have seen many posts about these hinges, and am utterly frustrated.  This wasn't a cheap machine, and I'm being told that I can't source parts myself to fix it, and batteries aren't available. I'm in the UK, has anyone got any ideas about where to go from here.  The machine is still perfectly functional and more than meets my needs still. I find it hard to believe that a machine has such a short functional life cycle.

I purchased this laptop in May 2019. One Hinge is broken. On reading various forum, it’s informing that should be covered in warranty but after opening the case, HP informed me that hinge broken where clips are broken so not covered. They saying if screw came loose or some glue issue, they could have resolved under warranty. Now as a help their sales team is telling me to fix it in £175. TBH this is tip off for one hinge and showing various local stores they all saying it’s a very bad design which breaks hinge within a year. This laptop is used very gently by one person always. One my friend also had the same issue with this models and design. I would have thought such issues must be covered in warranty and must be repaired by companies.

Hello,
I have the same issue.
Left hinge has malfunctioned, and the screen is beginning to separate from the case near the hinge.
Laptop was purchased Nov 2020 so it is out of warranty.
But this appears to be a very common and known issue with the Envy X360.
 
Is there any assistance that HP can provide? 
Thank you

My right hinge bulge  and is open at the back. My left hinge is also cracking and bulging. I can not close the top and the rim started cracking and now is broken closer to the bottom and stays open at the bottom. There is a little wire that is cut and sticks out. What shall I do? Apparently a common problem. I like HP and this has been my choice for years, I already had 3. I am disappointed now.

I have a HP Envy (Model: M7-J020DX) purchased in December of 2013. I talked to you guys about this almost a year later and was informed my warranty was expired and to note, it expired a month earlier than it should have as this was a Christmas gift, None the less, I searched online and saw this was an ongoing thing with you guys and Envy model laptops. Hinges broken all over the place and no one doing anything to fix them because it almost seems like they are timed to break right after the warranty expires. I know what may sound ludacris but this is the same response I've been reading from people all over the internet and HP will NOT acknowledge this problem. I'm sure that this is just a simple fix and should not be all this headache but I dropped over a thousand dollars on this laptop to have it break less than a year and HP tell me there's nothing that can be done about it. It's insanity that a company that takes your money won't keep the end consumer happy. So I am posting this here beacuse the seperation between the screen and the base is becoming more and more apparent and it's not fair that I should have to deal with this or eat this cost. HP - I'm throwing the ball back in your court. Do something about this. Seriously. Actually DO SOMETHING.

I bought this bad boy a year ago and it had obviously been sitting in their backroom since being shipped when it was released. The laptop has performed rather beautifully for what it is but within a month of purchase the left hinge was showing signs of wear and made opening and closing the lid rather stressful.As i don't really take my laptop anywhere I essentially turned the laptop into a desktop and set everything up so the hinge never needed to be used. Despite making use of the lid closed feature laptops are known less than 20 or so times, the hinge completely failed this past weekend and I appear to have lost signal to the monitor. I am not in any position to buy a new system, and am not trying to waste my time getting HP to cover it or acknowledge the obviously lack of effort put into designing and manufacturing a hinge that works even close to an acceptable level. What I am trying to find is the product repair/disassembly guide and maybe a point in the direction of the parts list so I can see about fixing it myself.Until then I should be able to just keep it hooked up to an external and it will at least allow me to use the rest of the computer, correct? Does anyone know if it's possible to get the OS to stop recognizing the built in display so the broken monitor doesn't count against the 3 displays the processor can handle? I really appreciate any and all help - i'm not expecting the world I just want to be able to use the rest of the computer until I am able to actually replace it, which may not be for a few months.

						I've had the same problem as seen in 8 previous pages on this forum. My wife opened our 1 month old, $2000 hp spectre x360 laptop to find the screen had cracked. By the time we got the laptop to hp, the cracks had spread and some shards of glass fallen out near the origin of the crack at one hinge. Hp have deemed this as physical damage and quoted us $523 for repairs, on what without doubt was a defective screen. I can't even begin to express my anger and disappointment at both the quality of hp screens based on the 8 pages of similar issues, and the ridiculous quoted repair costs. I could buy a new laptop for less. With this level of customer service, I don't see hp maintaining their reputation of quality.

I purchased this laptop on July 3rd, 2018 from Sam's Club to replace my wife's older 17 inch HP laptop. Starting from last week, I noticed the top panel was higher than the edge in the right hinge area where the screen is attached to the base. I pushed it back thinking the clip just popped, but came to find out that every time I opened and closed the screen, it will pop back up. After further investigation, I found out the right hinge in the base holding the screen was completely broken into pieces and the plastic chips were scattered everywhere under the hinge area inside the base.  I have bought three HP 17-inch laptops over the last 10 years, and this one is really short lived. I never had this type of problem from the other two HPs. Does anyone know how to fix this? I did a lot of search online, but couldn't find much information on how to fix the right hinge cracking on this exact model.

My daughters computer is coming away at the left hinge. When I have searched the issue it seems most are coming away from the bottom but on her's it looks like the place where the hinge screw into the screen is broken. The actual plastic where the screw holds it together has broken and the plastic is still on the screw and not attached to the cover anymore.Not sure if this can be fixed with glue or a replaced piece or not.

I bought an HP laptop and the hinge broke. The HP warranty expired, but I bought the extended warranty from Costco and that is still valid. They told me that HP still won't fix it. I didn't do anything wrong. It has a large screen and over time it has become looser and looser and it finally cracked. How do I get it fixed? How much does it cost to get a hinge fixed?

Less than 3 years, the left hinge has broken and caused the screen to crack.  Upon opening the lid up, I heard a crack and noticed the left hinge had separated from the screen. The screws came out of the display panel.  The computer is working fine, but this seems to be a recurring issue for many people with this laptop. It looks like a manufacturing/design defect.

This question has appeared a few times on this site already (it seems like a common issue), so I wanted to open it again. I've had this laptop for around 2-3 years, and sadly my warranty expired after only 1 year. A few months ago whilst closing my laptop I heard a loud crack and a two screws popped out of my laptop, which appeared to be holding the screen onto the hinges. After carefully opening my laptop again (and keeping it permanently open to avoid further damage), I continued to use it as normal, since I'm at university and it contains all of my work. I contacted HP customer support to see how much it was to repair these hinges and they said it would cost £314!After some protest they were willing to offer the same service for £220, but this still seems ridiculous for a laptop that cost me around £600, and was damaged not by carelessness but by simply CLOSING the laptop. Since then, the screen has begin to suffer from glitches and colour issues, which has made the laptop increasingly difficult to use, but I can't really afford to throw £220 at a laptop I already bought outright, just for this problem to emerge again in a couple years time. From what I understand, this is an INCREDIBLY common issue with this type of laptop.The user @Huershut in this thread: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/HP-Envy-x360-Broken-Hinge/td-p...mentioned in 2018 that he managed to get his x360 repaired for free, and I wondered what the conditions of this free repair were, and whether or not such a thing would be available to me and others who experience this issue. Thank you for reading this little rant,sincerely,A worried student

I purchased a HP Envy TS 15 notebook in December 2014 and so far it works fine but no longer under warranty.  However, the left hinge of the laptop is broken which leaves the top left corner of the plastic cover with a slanted appearance against the screen.  Also I noticed from previous posts that there is a flaw with the hinges with some of the HP Envy laptops.  Now, what can be done to fix the broken hinge?  Thanks for your assistance.

Looks like a serious issue on these laptops!!! I have this machine for when I attend meetings and was bought in late November 2020 to save taking my Z Book workstation with me. The unit has had very little use and has succumbed to same issue I'm seeing reading through the posts here, which seems to have been an ongoing issue for many years!! On moving the laptop to tablet mode sat at home two weeks ago, the hinge detached from the body and has punched the screen out of its bezel, I can't close it for fear of doing more damage and the screen seems damaged and black down the left hand side.    Disappointingly my calls for support have been met with ""your machine is out of warranty and will require a chargeable fix"". Bearing in mind the unit is 2 months out of warranty I find this disgusting, seems HP are scamming the masses (not going to go into the £400 Thunderbolt Dock I have for my Z Book that has never worked properly!!!). I'd add I've had to call 4 times, having been told I would be contacted by the service dept, only to find I was lied to and placated to get rid of me as it would seem the ticket number I requested and was told ""you don't get one"" was a complete fabrication!! Luckily the person I dealt with yesterday was more helpful and I now have a ticket. I'm still not holding out much hope to be honest, hence taking to the forum, I would have hoped HP would look after their loyal customers better than this, I work in an industry where tens of thousands are spent on HP Z Book Workstations, not sure I could recommend HP to any of my peers going forward after such a poor experience.

I've had this laptop for awhile already, it was gifted to me for college. I have abosulutely no complaints about the software but upon coming home from class one day I had noticed a screw had fallen out from the back/bottom. After that first screw more and more turned up missing. The laptop was fine for a couple months without those screws, but about a month ago a crack appeared near the power button. I thought nothing of it thinking it was just normal wear and tear from opening and closing the laptop. But just last night the crack near the power button cracked more causing that broken part to come up whenever the laptop is opened, as well as the hinge is out of place. This crack/lifting of the plastic has exposed a wire, so now I am forced to keep the laptop open in order to not further damage the hardware as well as possibly mess up my display/screen.  In short, the laptop is in need of repair and the laptop is vital for my education right now. The warranty is expired, however are the loose screws manufacturer error, I haven't done anything in order to cause these screws to fall out. Once again, I appreciate any help that can be offered. Thank you again in advance!

Dear reader,My HP envy 13 laptop hinge broke, and the left corner is cracked. The laptop was not dropped and did not fell. When I open and close the laptop the hinge is shifting and then separating lower case from the upper case. The screen also came loose from the back side of the laptop. The laptop is just 2,5 years old. The warranty expired just 4 months ago. I also noticed from several posts on the platform that i am not the only one with this problem. Please help! Thanks in advance

Bought this Laptop 6 months ago, the hinges have always been ""stiff"".  Noticed that the left hand hinge is broken and is pulling the case away when I open the machine. Sent away for repair through Curry's/PC World expecting the repair to be carried out under the manufacture's warranty to then be informed that this fault is not covered by the warranty. Apparently I am alleged to have pushed the laptop lid back too far, which I have not done, the machine stays open on a desk most days. In my view this is clearly a design fault, when I check the internet I can see there are many threads about this issue going back a number of years on HP machines. That been the case why have they not installed a ""brake"" which prevents the hinges going to far back? What is back just enough and ooops back to far? Really annoyed that I may have to pay for a repair which I do not believe is my fault, for what appears to be a VERY common problem on HP machines.

Hello! Unfortunately I have the same well known issue with Envy laptop hinge, in my case - right one. When I open the laptop there is the cracking sound and bottom cover on the right side next to the hinge and the screen has opened up. It is really disappointing since I like my Envy laptop and so far I was satisfied with it. For me it was a surprise that this problem happens quite often and I'm not the only one who has it. Now I'm a bit worried about HP support since in thenet there are lot of comments about very passive reaction and support from HP Inc. side. I do really hope that it was in the past and now I will have a full support and help to solve this construction (design) defect.

Only 13 months after purchase, I can't open my laptop without the keyboard and what's below it becoming separated from the case.  It appears to be a problem with the hinge.  I brought it to a reputable repair facility and was told the repair would cost more than the price of the laptop.  Has anyone experienced this and asked HP to rectify it?  I contacted HP customer service online two days ago and have not received a reply.  This is my first HP laptop after years of using Dells.

The right hinge on my ENVY x360 spontaneously came apart yesterday. I didn't do anything to break it. Two screws came out and the right corner of the computer came apart. After four calls to the support line, no one was interested in helping me. I was told that since my computer was out of the warranty period I could pay to fix it.That is dumb. It is a known issue.

Hello support. We have a very nice HP Envy that has been gently used, never abused, never dropped, adult owned. It is most likely out of warranty but... The left hinge has come loose and when we tried to open it last night, it completely let go and the screen cracked upon opening. Very frustrating considering its age. This appears to be a well known issue. Are you offering repairs for this manufacturing defect? Or could you send a new screen\digitizer and hinge and I will fix it myself? Please advise, thanks so much!

As the title says, the hinge on my laptop broke and with it, the screen case has opened at the corner. The warranty has just ended which is very annoying. IMO this kind of build failure is unacceptable in a relatively new machine. The machine has never been dropped or suffered any kind of mistreatment. The break happened during normal use.

I will start off by saying I take very good care of the device and I did not put physical stress such as dropping or mishandling it. The front bezel warped when I left it running overnight on a cooling pad in a chilled room with sufficient ventilation and the only mistake you could blame me for would be I left the screen lid closed, that's all I did and it was just downloading a large file not running on any sort of high performance mode. I remember running it on power saver. I can not understand how the bezel warped from such a basic use case??? I didn't say much about that and assumed it is a user error but I will say it's horrible build quality, like seriously how can you make a device that can't do basic things.  I want to know what do I do with the gap because it is ugly and the device is over 1y old out of warranty now. I actually tried 2 part epoxy which surprisingly wasn't enough to  keep it together which probably happened because of the heat output from the laptop and constant stress, I didn't use too much in fear that it might crack the LCD panel if it was to chip off Now I do no know how the heck the back bezel came loose, I tried pushing it down to put it back in place but that didn't work, I want to know how to fix that bezel because I don't even know how that warped and came loose. I am just confused how it can just pop open like that with daily use and I don't abuse it or travel with it. At closer inspection, I can also see a hairline crack where the back cover popped off Hoping for a home solution that could help it at least

I am customer of one of the best computer manufacturing company “M/s HP” and I own Laptop model X360 -14 cd0055tx. I purchased this laptop in Oct 2019 with 3 years warranty (1 year + 2 year extended through HP care) . I found suddenly on dated 17.10.2022, that the Display touch screen is coming out from right side from clamp automatically. I also noticed that one of the screw from display came out from inside which might hold the touch screen to the back side panel. However, the laptop screen/touch panel is working properly but it is difficult to fold the laptop.  It is to mention  that I have used/handled the laptop as per recommendation of HP notebook handled with too much care and it is never fallen even accidently.I am surprised that all these things happened exactly after expiry of warranty (1 +2 =3 year) on 16.10.2022. I approached to nearby service centre regarding the issue at Trichy (Wipro Skypro Technologies- 620017) on 19.10.2022 and the agency suggested to replace the entire LED touch panel without going for any rectification/repair and they estimated spare cost approx. Rs. 29500/. It may be noted that this cost is approx. 42 % of purchase cost. (Invoice Rs. 72,990/- . This is the cost which I have to pay for quality issue which shouldn t occur. In this context, M/s HP, being a reputed company and dedicated for customer satisfaction based business, I humbly request to look into it and arrange to repair my Laptop display issue free of cost considering the quality issue of x360 laptop hinges. I read in the community and found so many similar cases.

Hi Team, I am having an issue with HP Envy x360 model where the screen is cracked as soon as the hinge got broken. Its been less than 5 months since I bought the product and it already got issues. Additionally this is isn't the first time this model has had a broken hinge. There seems to be some fundamental issue with the x360 model design because I have had same issue on two of these models. Can you guys help to fix/replace this? Looking forward to hearing from HP Support

When opening my laptop a few days ago the left hinge crack and the lid has separated. It's currently being held together by a heavy duty binder clip and cannot be closed which means I can't take it any place. My laptop just went out of warranty in May. I've own several HP laptops over the years and nothing like this has ever happened. A bit disappointed in the quality.Regards, Van47

HelloI bought HP Envy x360 laptop in nov 2020.From the second month I took out this laptop from the box, it has been experiencing one or the other problem, be it related to sound problem, touchpad issue, keyboard freeze or overheating. Now, today, (everything was normal) I was using my laptop, and when i tried to close it, i heard a crack sound. I saw that the right hinge  broke, taking away with itself the screen as well.I immediately went over to Google about this and to my surprise i found that this didn't happen only with me, but is a common problem faced by a lot of envy laptop users. This seems to be because of the faulty design and manufacturing of the hinges. I talked to a customer service representative and i was again and again told to pay for the repair.Why should i pay for a damage due to company's defect? My laptop is well within warranty and i don't have any money to spend on the company's fault. I never expected such an experience with a premium hp product.I expect the company to resolve this issue soon at no cost to me.

The left hinge broke one morning when I opened my laptop. I have not dropped it or forced it closed so I have no idea why it happened. I've seen many other people complain about the same thing. And to add insult to injury, the laptop randomly drops the wi-fi connection. The wi-fi is working just fine, it's the laptop. I've owned this laptop just over 2 years so I understand my warranty has expired. Since this seems to be a widespread HP problem, is HP offering any compensation?

Anyone had any luck getting HP to admit they have a default in the Envy hinges (the back support)?  I have owned the 13"" model for 19 months and the hinge snapped off the back support top.  HP refuses to acknowledge the defect and is requiring the user pay for any repairs that are out of warranty.  This is unacceptable. Laptop was never dropped and  based on the numerous forum comments (not just HPs forum either) this is a HUGE problem they refuse to step and do the right thing.  Go search for HP HINGE ISSUE and you will be amazed!!  No more HP for me.

The left hinge has become detached/broken on the monitor side . This in turn cause the bottom monitor frame to pop out. Over the past few weeks, it got significantly worst as I am unable to close or open the laptop to prevent further damage. The screen works perfectly good with no cracks on it.  Originally it can’t as a surprise because the laptop was kept in good condition, without any drops or bumps with very minimal use. However after doing some research, i came to know that it seems to be a common issue among this model, suggesting this a manufacturing defect.  Could you please let me know if there was any system in place to resolve and if so, what further actions can be taken?

I have been using my HP laptop from September 10, 2016, onwards.   The only problem that I faced other than the occasional screen blackouts were the poor hinges. My laptop's left hinge was slightly broken during the second year of its use and I being a very careful user was really sad at this, but me being a student with not much money to go about decided that I can make it work thus I was using it till now. But yesterday (07/04/2020), the hinge broke completely when I was closing it after a client call. I too am working from home and during this quarantine time, I am very much in need of a laptop. I saw here that the broken hinge is a common problem with HP laptops, now I too am part of that gang. Can someone help me in this situation?.I cannot close my laptop, it is kept open as it is and not disturbed but I need to fix it ASAP.  Can you help me, kind sir?

I own a HP Envy x360 laptop and one fine day the right hinge just gave away.  The screen seems to work fine however is popped out from the back panel near the right hinge.  Looking at the issue it seems that the screws that attach the hinges with the back panel are plastic parts and that seems to have broken.  This is a bit disappointing since the model is supposed to be a premium model  and I paid over $1100 for this.When I contacted the HP support I was told that I'll have to pay over $400 to have this repaired since my laptop is out of warranty.  A casual search in the HP community reveals that a lot of users of the Envy x360 model have reported this issue.  Disappointing that HP seems to have not fixed this issue.Have any of the HP users able to fix this issue?  Any help would be much appreaciated!

Hi,Yesterday my laptop was working perfectly but today when I try to open it, it feels like the laptop jams and I can feel it straining and it looks like the screen would split if I forced it open. I think the problem is with the right hinge.According to the HP website the warranty expired, however I bought it from another website last December, and I'm still within 12 months, so warranty is still valid there for another few days. I know the problem is a common design fault from googling. What should I do? I'd really like to keep my data. Should I try and force the laptop open and risk damaging it, or should I remove the harddrive before sending it back for investigation?

HelloI have had this laptop since February of 2013. It has perfromed flawlessly. With the exception of the lid. The plastic housing around hinges have broken twice. The first time a maintence engineer at the TV station i worked for fixed it for me. Within the last week the right hinge is broken again. It closes but that side is raised up and needs to be pushed down gently. Is there and inexpensive fix for this? The computer is awesome the casing around it not so much.  I see the peices coming apart slowly. HELP please.

I have my HP-Pavilion laptop in a very well-maintained excellent condition since the past 3 years. Recently I noticed that the left hinge of the laptop has become quite loose and is moving up and down while opening and closing the screen of the laptop. This problem with the hinge has caused a big bulging crack on the top left side of my keyboard which I don't know how to fix. My laptop is out of warranty but all this problem has not been caused by any of my fault because I never dropped or hurt the laptop. I urge the HP community to look into this matter and help me fix this.

Recently, while closing the laptop, I've heard a crack sound and the strip covering the edges of display unit was bulging at the left bottom corner. The left hinge seems to be damaged. Since then, I've left the laptop open. The laptop was never dropped or mishandled in anyway.

back 3-4 month, I accidently pressed my laptop bottom of the lid, between the hinge by my knee. I got a small crack sound, but there was no external physical damage. I opened up my laptop and I got quarter half of the screen completely dark. I was so afraid so I pressed the middle-bottom of the hinge again and it got horrible. The remaining part of the display which was usable got faded to white when logging in to windows. after a day when i repressed the exact same position as before, the remaining part of display came back to working, but it started to flicker randomly. so I to toggle privacy button which indeed reduced the flickering.I'm currently using my laptop with quarter half black screen and that Flickering issue is gone slowly, but completely after months of usage. the remaining screen is working perfectly for now. This post is written in this laptop as shown below:   I went through reddit, quara & youtube in search of causes & solutions. Most of them included either the problem is with display panel or the ribbon cables.But i think the mini circuit boards which connects the display panel & the ribbon cable is broken. I don't want to waste money buying the display being reluctant, if the problem was with other parts. I want to know the exact component causing the problem so i can replace with without hesitation.

My laptop hinge hasbroken. I was unable to reopen my screen after a small break from homework. This cost me my assignment. My laptop has never been dropped. I googled about the HP laptop and found many articles about broken HP Laptop hinges. Seems to be a very common issue. Such a shame that HP hasn't addressed and corrected the issue.  This is such a huge inconvenience and I wish I knew before purchasing the laptop. It just turned a year a couple of weeks ago, since I purchased the laptop. Since day one, I could tell the hinges were flimsy. I could hear it and feel it, every time I opened it. What a coincidence it happened shortly after my 1 year. How can I get this fixed without it costing half or more than I paid for the laptop itself.

My right hand hinge was forcing the keypad metal plate to come up if I close and open my laptop.  I took it apart to find that there were two screws put into plastic pieces to hold the hinge.  Those both were broken.  I had to take all the plastic pieces out and the screws.  Now if I squeeze the corner with my hand, I can close the laptop.  If I want to open it, I have to do the same.  This takes effort and time.  I can't just pull it up or close it fast.  I don't know who thought this was a good design putting a tiny metal hinge in a laptop connected to plastic.  The hinge needs great force to use compared to the size.  Because it is attached to plastic, I am surprised it didn't break within the first 6 months.  It is like they knew it was strong enough to last to the end of the warranty only.  The design needs to have the hinge be almost the whole side of the laptop for how much force is put on it.  It also need more area for screws when it is only attached to plastic.  The laptop would last for many years if this was the case.  How do I fix this without spending lots of money?

Second time this has happened with an HP Envy laptop. After a few years and now well out of warranty, a perfectly fine laptop is being ripped apart by a broken hinge. Every time I open or close it, the screen is being separated from the case. I feel like I see these a lot, but there is no known fix. Or maybe there is, an HP employee chimes in and takes it private so we never get to actually see the resolution.

I opened my laptop screen today too suddenly find my left hinge broken and the plastic screen casing popping out.  My laptop has never been dropped nor received any damage as it sits in one location and I only occassionally open and close the screen. Perusing the forums just a bit, this seems to be a common problem because of poor manufacturing.  Any suggestions about how to fix this? Thanks.

I was using my laptop and closed it and came back to it 10 minutes later. When I re-opened it, the left hinge all of a sudden cracked and broke and I cannot full open the device. I have never dropped it, and this issue is what happened to thelast HP laptop I had. Because of this issue in my last laptop, I got this one about a year ago and am surprised that it had such a malfunction.From what I understand, this is a common HP-specific issue?

Hinge on right side separated from outer shell of display. I can see the weak physical connection is weak due to the insufficient amount of material that is supposed to be holding the mounting screws in place.  My wife takes great care of her laptop and generally leaves it open on the desk.  We purchased this in April 2018. I even paid for the extended 1 year warranty. Which of course expired before this problem became evident. This is an obvious design defect. Please let me know how HP will assist me

I have a left hinge on my HP laptop that has broken two times now. The first time it was within one  month of warranty expiration. They fixed for free and now , one year later, it is broken again. I contacted HP and  they said repair would be $320.20 but they would help me out by offering me a 25% discount. Getting it repaired would be $260 and I would probably pay the shipping.  The PR person said in so many words ""things wear out in time"". I didn't know laptops needed to be replaced every two years. HP has an issue here? Why can't they do the right thing and issue a recall on these products? Is there a government agency to complain to ? Any help would be appreciated.

I suspect it is the same hinge problem that seems to be somewhat common with HPs.  Has anyone found a reasonable way to fix this?  I was quoted $300 if it is the bottom part (mount) and more if the hinge is broken.  I can buy a new laptop for just a little more.  Although the computer has worked well otherwise, the cheap shell is going to lead me to other brands. Sad.

My computer's Ethernet port clip has snapped, not the hinge, but the plastic itself has broken. This is the part that bends down to clip the Ethernet cable into the computer.  If I hold the cable in the Ethernet port my computer still receives data through it.  Let me know if you need any more specifics that i haven't thought of.

We bought a  new  17 inch HP with a good processor, reasonable memory  to start- 8GB-and SSD last Thanksgiving for my husband. THe case seemed a bit cheapish and was stiff to open but  we thought (perhaps incorreclty) that HP wouldnt sell something  intrinsically defective.My husband uses this laptop  as his principal home laptop (not for work but personal stuff)  and in the course of just opening and closing the lid, as is customary on any laptop, over the last few months, the case cracked and broke around each hinge; we see other HP products have also had issues around hinges, and we are just flabbergasted that this seems to be yet another widespread quality issue. The laptop is under warranty and we've sent it in, but wanted to note on this forum that this type of HP quality issue is unacceptable and should be addressed . WE hope someone from HP on this forum will see this and respond.THanks.W.

I bought three HP Envy M7's and two out of three the left hinge has broken. Screens are seperating and you can not close. They are 15 months old, I am disgusted with everyone having the same problem and HP not fixing them or recalling the computers. I will NEVER buy another HP. I need to knw the hinge part so I can fix these cheap but expensive laptops!

I always tried to handle the laptop in a proper way, always carried it in a way it should be. I had trust in HP as a company, but I experienced already several repairs during the warranty period which were desperately needed as the hardware was not functional (webcam, battery, even screen leakage!). I'm anxious to see what will happen in near future as this is a sign that the laptop has badly designed construction - the screen (17'') is apparently wery heavy and it puts a lot of strain on the hinges when opening and closing it and the material does not keep up. I guess the laptops seem to be made to last only 2 years? Can I somehow avoid the crack getting bigger?

Hello! I purchased my laptop in late 2020, and essentially never really used the laptop. I have a much more powerful desktop that I used everyday, and the laptop just sat on my desk. I would use it occasionally for taking notes during lectures, but no misuse at all. Today, I picked up my laptop to transfer something over onto an SD card, and I noticed that the hinge on the left side had broken. I literally have barely used this laptop over the year and half that I've had it, so I was shocked to see this. After some searching on the internet, I found that this was a common problem with this specific model. I looked around a bit, and couldn't find any official replacements, but regardless I feel it's a bit strange that I would have to pay to replace something that was clearly a engineering error. Was wondering if I could get any help on this. Don't really want to pay but if it comes down to it, and it isn't super expensive, as I barely even use the laptop, would be down.

Hello everyone, seems like we have fallen victim to the broken hinge issue. My wife is a teacher and uses this laptop everyday, she takes great care of it and just yesterday was surprised when the right hinge popped the cover off. As we opened it back up it proceeded to brake the monitor on said corner! Luckily it turned on and we were able to save the files we needed. I spent the day looking into it and found that this is a very very common fault in the HP design. What is HP doing to serve their customers who own these fully designed laptops? We are not the only ones experiencing this problem, anyone have the solution to getting HP to fix this? thank you!Yaril Quintana

I'm writing with regards to my HP Envy TouchSmart 15 Notebook PC, model: 15-j003cl. I love my laptop but recently, I've been experiencing problems with the bottom of the case at the rear separating at the hinges and rear corners. I can hear cracking every time I lift open the screen, and you can hear little pieces of plastic rattling all inside the laptop. The screen cannot be held up steadily anymore as the hinges are no longer supported by the breaking case. The hinges themselves don't seem broken, just the plastic that's around the hinge areas. The two corner screws at the rear-bottom of the case no longer hold the case together. There is no threading at the back end, so the screws have nothing to screw into when I use a screwdriver. I can't seal the case. The bottom of the case in the rear on both the left and right side corners no longer sit flush and you can see the separation. I'm afraid the entire rear corners of the case will continue to separate and the hardware within will not be attached/connected correctly. I'm unable to find a HP contact email to send this inquiry. Anybody know how to help get HP support? My laptop is not under warranty, but I can't find a place to submit my inquiry. I included pictures below. Thank you!Left rear - screen open Left rear - screen closed Right rear - screen closed Right rear - screen open Bottom - left rear Bottom - left rear Bottom - right rear

I sent my HP laptop into get fixed a few months ago because its hinge kept breaking and so the top cover was also becoming detached.

I would really appreciate if someone could help me fix this issue.

The right hinge of my HP ENVY x360 is broke, and I can no longer use my laptop as it's designed for fear of causing damage to the screen.  Is there an extended warranty to address the failing hinges on HP ENVY x360?  I can not find one and Support has told me no, but I can send it in for them to repair at a cost close to what I could pay for a new laptop?!?! I purchased my laptop over a year and a half ago. Within the first year of owning my laptop, I had to send it in to HP under warranty to replace the left side hinge for the same issue the right side hinge now has (i.e. broken and causing the screen to separate).  My laptop is no longer under warranty and I should not have to pay HP almost the cost of a new to now replace/fix the right side. Based on searches on this forum and other places this is clearly a poor design issue with the hinges. I have NEVER dropped or misused my laptop. I take extremely good care of it and it stays mostly on my desk as a desktop. Heaven forbid I should have regular need to use it as designed - flip it around to use as a pad/design board. I just want to be able to appropriately shut my laptop without fear of damaging the screen. The poor design of the hinges causing the screen to separate as part of normal use should not be a repair I have to fund myself.  Extremely disappointed in this product and if HP is not willing to stand behind their design flaws to fix the issue, the I will not be purchasing HP products in the future. A laptop in this price range should not break after just more than one year and a half of normal usage.

One time I even had smoke coming out of the Fan area because of some plastic piece!!! I have never used the laptop haphazardly and always picked up from both the sides so I believe it's not a usage fault and it's never fallen down or something. I think It's a design fault.I am told the company has stopped manufacturing the spare parts for this laptop, which doesn't make sense. Shouldn't the company be concerned about getting so many complaints about the ENVY series and make better - newer parts? I need a solution to this, what do I do!?? Help me get a proper fix, please.

My HP Envyx360 was purchased in Dec. 2017, and the warranty expired in 2018. I primarily use my laptop at home and it has never sustained any damages or drops. Suddenly, I was slowly closing the screen and noticed it wouldn't close all the way - I see that the right lower hinge has come out of place. The screen is still functional without any damages. I found behind the screen, a small piece of metal that appears to have broken off of the hinge as well as one screw. I'm extremely disappointed, I've taken really good care of this laptop.  I've searched so many community posts and there are literally thousands of others that have experienced the same issue, it is so frustrating. This is a manufacturers problem that has effected so many of these laptops. How do I go about getting this addressed with HP? In addition, I cannot close the laptop and thus I wouldn't be able to ship it for repairs.

Hi.The right hinge of my HP ENVY x360 just broke, the screen popped loose down in the corner and two screws fell out together with some plastic ""crumbles"".I bought my computer from the HP store at the end of November 2017. I have not dropped or misused the computer in any way and do not even use the screen in the tablet option, I take really good care of it, but based on the tons of complaints around this same problem on this forum (and elsewhere) it is obvious that the hinge design is really poor.I am obviously very unhappy with this and think that HP must offer an extended warranty for this particular problem.A computer in this price range should not break through infrequent normal usage!

My laptop hinge has a problem 2 months after the day I bought it, the left area near the hinge is a bit loose. But I don't really care so Ignore it until a month ago I noticed some screws are falling out inside, everytime I shake my laptop I hear screws dancing inside my laptop, again I Ignored it. A few days after that my the left area near the hinge is starting to get loose, I opened my laptop and saw the screw holder has reduced to atom, I tried gluing the hinge to the bottom cover but that didd't turned well. Because gluing it to bottom cover didn't worked I tried another stupid idea to glue the loose area (Bottom cover and top cover), it worked but has a major problem, the hinge is still loose with only 1 screw holding it, bad looking super glue residue, and some clanky noises everytime I close or open my laptop. My touchpad has a problem too, the left pad is a bit loose.  I'm planning to fix them all, but I don't know which parts should I replace and the cost of them. It is only the  hinge, bottom cover, and touchpad? or I must replace the top cover too? Will it cost me over 100 bucks? does fixing in different region will cost less? I live in Indonesia Another question, will they give me new rubber feet if I replaced my bottom cover?

I have a HP Pavilion 15-p043cl notebook that has a broken hinge and back cover. I suspect the rod that goes up the back panel snapped and broke through the cover, leading to the broken hinge cover on the bezel. I purchased a new back cover and hinges, but need a new bezel to complete the system. I ordered the bezel listed in parts surfer, but it is apparently for the non-touchscreen version. Can somebody direct me to the bezel that works with the touchscreen version of this notebook? Thank you in advance. Nathan

The left hinge on my HP Envy Touchsmart 17-J178CA Notebook broke yesterday, leaving lots of little broken pieces of black plastic inside the notebook (I believe these are the remnants of what the hinge screws into).  The notebook was purchased in April 2015 directly from HP online and is no longer under warranty.  I have seen several posts in this forum and elsewhere on the Internet regarding similar issues with HP Envy notebooks (I would have added my post to one of the earlier posts but I cannot figure out how to reply to other posts on this forum).  This has been a great notebook during the last four years.  Of all the things that could possibly go wrong, the hinge was not even on my radar.  This was totally unexpected and caught me completely off-guard.  I am not really sure what to do.  I can fix most things but this seems to be beyond a simple fix and I am not even sure what parts would need to be ordered and whether the required parts are even available.  Is there a fix available for this?  Thank you very much.  Michael

I purchased an HP 15t last year in August for my wife's work. The laptop sees very little use (just a few weeks total in the whole of last year) and treated with care. Today my wife closed the case and one of the hinges cracked away from the screen case, or something like that. Upon inspection, this appears to be caused by a very stiff hinge and rather shoddy construction quality. This leads me to suspect that many buyers must have experienced a similar break.I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this product. My warranty is undoubtedly expired but I would like to hear from the community and from HP about this issue. What can I do? It gets so little use, it is practically new. The tech on the inside is not out of date and we would like to continue to use it. Is $800 dollars down the toilet because of a hinge? We do not have the resources to pay to fix it or buy a replacement. Unacceptable, really.Thank you for reading,Zachary Hutchinson

I have an HP Envy TS m7-J078CA Notebook and the left hinge has detached from the bottom base cover. The problem is so bad that pieces of the bottom casing have broken off where the left panel fan holes are and there are a couple of cracks in that area. Everytime I open the Notebook, I hear a popping sound making me think that the damage is getting worse. Just the other day, I noticed a piece broke off again, looks like where the hinge connects to the bottom cover. This seems to be a common issue with these with this version of the HP Envy Notebooks (15.6 inch and 17.3 inch), both in the US and Canada. I have a 17.3 inch screen and because it was an i& Notebook, I paid a lot of money for it. I am very dissatisfied with the HP Notebook. I previously owned an HP Pavillion Laptop and never had an issue with any of the hinges. I feel like I got sold a lemon this time around because the design of this Notebook is flawed and not very well thought out. I have seen numerous posts about this same issue, so it seems that this problem is rampant. I can just imagine how much it will cost to fix this, because not only does the base cover need to be changed, but I'm sure the hinges need to be changed as well. I read in another post, another poster had the same issue and was able to get it fixed under his warranty period, but the same problem developed after the warranty had expired, thats why I feel I was sold a lemon in buying this HP Notebook. As you can see in the picture, some of the notches in the fan hole are have broken away, as well there are a couple of cracks. Definitely not very happy!

One of the hinges on my Pavilion laptop is broken and it is causing the plastic casing around the screen to detach. The problem is concentrated in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, where the casing is stuck to the extent that I cannot fully open the laptop. I bought this laptop almost 3 years ago so it is no longer in warranty, but it is otherwise in great shape and I have never had any problems with it - it has been well looked after and it has never been dropped or damaged. I would appreciate any help or advice anyone could give me on getting this issue fixed.

Hello, I am looking for some help in regard to a broken left side screen hinge on my approximately 2 year old HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15m-bq0xx.  I am currently unable to shut my screen down to close the laptop and the lower left corner of my screen has popped loose from the assembly.  It seems like this is a common occurrence for the ENVY line from what I have been reading.  Since the HP Policy on support is pretty poor in regards to having email, chat or phone support after the initial warrantee period expires for services such as a failure of the device I am writing today to see if someone can help point me in the right direction to get this repaired.  Approximately 2 weeks ago I placed a ticket request through some means on the support app but that did not provide me any additional details on the next steps for me to begin the repair process. I selected this HP product as it seemed to be the best bang for my buck but unfortunately this is now the second repair that I am having to have done to my device within 2 years on a gently used and well taken care of device.  It is quite unfortunate as I have had laptops from many brands, treated them with the same care and have not encountered the same defects as I have with this machine.  Can someone please help point me in the direction on where to go for this repair?   Thanks!

I am really unsatisfied with how HP is treating their customer. Zero caring and appreciation.  This is yet another unattended case from THE HP. The automatically broken hinge system! Bravo. How did you guys invent the automated broken machine? And also, not taking any responsibility for it.  This problem was not only occurred by me. There are a lot of customers who had suffered from HP's own errors and flaws and all they did was to even take more advantage of these victims.  U know whats happen to the hinge of this 15-inch laptop design. U know this model has this major error and U do nothing.  Oh, and your HP employee tries to cover up my letter of complaint. Do not let them do it again or I swear I will sue the local HP authorized Center in my ***bleep*** country.
